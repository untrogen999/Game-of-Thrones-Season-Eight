TITLE SEQUENCE
<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection> WINTER TOWN - DAY
<stageDirection>A young boy runs through a snowy forest woods, he crosses a shallow stream and then runs through the streets of the winter town. As he runs through the town, pigs squeal and donkeys bray. He reaches the street and stands among a large crowd, struggling to see what is happening on the road. A man steps aside and the boy pushes through. Pan up to see <char who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</char> STARK smiling as she watches the boy run through. A large army is marching along the road and the boy continues to run alongside them. He finds a tree and climbs up it to get a good view. Pan up to see the army marching along the road from the winter town up to Winterfell. A man's shout can be heard, and the boy turns to face the rear of the army.

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls wonâ€™t freeze off.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS">VARYS</speaker> You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Because I have balls, and you don't.</speech>

<stageDirection>The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other. The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> and <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> as they ride past.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.</speech>

<stageDirection>A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring as <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>â€™ dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. <char who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</char> emerges from the crowd smiling.

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> looks at him quizzically and then up to <char who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</char> who is standing next to him.

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Where's Arya?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> Lurking somewhere.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> turns around to <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and she walks over to him.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</char> looks at <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> hesitantly.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="BRAN" house="Stark">BRAN</speaker> We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> turns to look at <char who="BRAN" house="Stark">BRAN</char>.</stageDirection>

<speaker who="BRAN" house="Stark">BRAN</speaker> He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.
<stageDirection><char who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</char>, <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> all look at each other concerned.</stageDirection>

<direction> CUT TO: WINTERFELL â€“ LARGE HALL</direction>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?</speech>

<stageDirection>A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="UMBER" house="Umber">UMBER</speaker> We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.</speech>

<stageDirection>He stops and then turns to look at <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char>.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="UMBER" house="Umber">UMBER</speaker> And my lord.</speech>

<stageDirection>He stops again and then turns to look at <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="UMBER" house="Umber">UMBER</speaker> And my queen. Sorry.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="UMBER" house="Umber">UMBER</char> bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="WOLKAN" house="Bolton">MAESTER WOLKAN</speaker>: At once, Your Grace.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="WOLKAN" house="Bolton">WOLKAN</char> exits.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="LYANNA" house="Mormont"> LYANNA </speaker> MORMONT: "Your Grace."</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="LYANNA" house="Mormont">LYANNA</char> stands up and walks forwards</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="LYANNA" house="Mormont">LYANNA</speaker> But youâ€™re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- Iâ€™m not sure what you are now.</speech>

<stageDirection>People start murmuring.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="LYANNA" house="Mormont">LYANNA</speaker> A lord? Nothing at all?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> It's not important.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="LYANNA" house="Mormont">LYANNA</speaker> Not important? We named you King in the North.</speech>

<stageDirection>People start cheering.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="MAN">MAN</speaker> King of the North!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. Iâ€™ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.</speech>

<stageDirection>People murmur. <char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> stands up and walks to the centre of the room.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.</speech>

<stageDirection>People grumble and yell out indistinctly.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Whatever they want.</speech>

<direction> CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</direction>

<stageDirection>Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon and <char who="GENDRY" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</char> catches it before it hits the ground.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="GENDRY" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</speaker> Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.</speech>

<stageDirection>MAN 1: Sorry â€™bout that.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection><char who="GENDRY" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</char> climbs into the back of one of the wagons.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="GENDRY" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</speaker> Are these the last of the wagons?</speech>

<stageDirection>The camera cuts to <char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> who is watching over the courtyard.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>MAN 2 (O.S.): Aye.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="GENDRY" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</speaker> All right, let's get it all to the forges.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> walks up to <char who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</char> and YOHN <char who="ROYCE" house="Royce">ROYCE</char>.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> My lord. My lady.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="ROYCE" house="Royce">ROYCE</char> exits.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> It had its moments.</speech>

<stageDirection>They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARA<char who="THEON" house="Greyjoy">THEON</char>.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> Apologies for leaving like that.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> We both survived.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.</speech>

<stageDirection>There is a short silence.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> She did.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> And you believed her?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</speaker> I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="SANSA" house="Stark">SANSA</char> exits and <char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> turns to see <char who="BRAN" house="Stark">BRAN</char> staring at him from the courtyard.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> turns around to see <char who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</char> standing near him.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> How did you sneak up on me?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</speaker> How did you survive a knife through the heart?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I didn't.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</char> laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their hug, <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> looks down to see <char who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</char>'s sword and scoffs in disbelief.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> You still have it.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</speaker> She doesn't like your queen, does she?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="QYBURN">QYBURN</speaker> That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.</speech>

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>: Can't argue with that.

<stageDirection>The three men start walking with each other.</stageDirection>

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> And our queen is grateful.</speech>

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

<stageDirection><char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> stops and thinks. He then catches up with   <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char> and <char> VARYS </char> who continued to walk.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> I sense that you're leading to a proposal.</speech>

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char> looks out over the castle wall.

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

<stageDirection><char> VARYS </char> and <char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> walk forward to look over the wall with   <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>, they see <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> and <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> standing and talking with each other.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> They do make a handsome couple.</speech>

<stageDirection><char> VARYS </char>: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> I'm not that old.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char> looks up at <char> VARYS </char> and then at   <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char>.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Not as old as him.</speech>

  <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char> chuckles.

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> Our queen respects the wisdom of age.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS"> VARYS </speaker>: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</speaker> What is that?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> What's wrong with them?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> They don't like the North.</speech>

<stageDirection>She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> and gets close. <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> climbs on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Go on.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I don't know how to ride a dragon.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Whatever you can.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past <char who="TYRION" house="Lanister">TYRION</char>,   <char who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</char> and <char> VARYS </char> who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char>. <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> and <char who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> So keep your queen warm.</speech>

<stageDirection><char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing <char who="JON" house="Stark">JON</char> to pull away.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Don't be afraid.</speech>
