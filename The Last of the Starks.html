      <h1>EPISODE 4 - LAST OF THE STARKS</h1>
      
      <p>EXT: WINTERFELL, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>JORAH MORMONT's body lies on an unlit funeral pyre. DAENERYS TARGARYEN mourns over
         his prone body. She leans down and kisses him gently on the forehead. She then whispers
         something in his ear.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA STARK weeps over THEON GREYJOY's dead body, her hand on his chest. She steps
         back, takes a Stark direwolf pin from her chest, and secures it on THEON's.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON SNOW, ARYA STARK, SAMWELL TARLY, and BRAN STARK stand amidst the Stark men, some
         of whom bear torches. DAENERYS joins the crowd a bit further down, next to GREY WORM,
         VARYS, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER. In front of the crowd are scores of funeral
         pyres in a grid. Stark soldiers stand at intervals with more torches. SANSA returns
         to the somber crowd, joining her siblings. Even GHOST stands obediently in mourning.
         JON steps forward to address those assembled.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers.
         To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight
         together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them
         a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in
         memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men
         draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never
         see their like again.</p>
      
      
      <p>Soldiers and Free Folk hand torches to JON, SANSA, ARYA, SAM, TORMUND GIANTSBANE,
         DAENERYS, and GREY WORM. They fan out to various pyres in the field, joining their
         fallen comrades for one final farewell" Soldiers and Free Folk hand torches to JON,
         SANSA, ARYA, SAM, TORMUND GIANTSBANE, DAENERYS, and GREY WORM. They fan out to various
         pyres in the field, joining their fallen comrades for one final farewell ARYA to BERIC
         DONDARRION, SAM to EDDISON TOLLETT, JON to LYANNA MORMONT. JON looks at DAENERYS.
         As one, they ignite the pyres. DAENYRYS watches the flames spread under JORAH, then
         turns away. The living return to the crowd and the flames rise higher. The air fills
         with a thick black smoke.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: WINTERFELL GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>The victory feast is somber and quiet, even though the hall is filled to capacity.
         At the head table sits BRAN, SANSA, JON, DAENERYS, and TYRION.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> To your health.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the crowd, GENDRY looks around. He turns back to the table where SANDOR "THE HOUND"
         CLEGANE eats hungrily. GENDRY takes a drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Have you seen Arya?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I just want to thank her for-</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> I'm sure you do.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Look, it's not about that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're
         not.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND takes a deep gulp of his wine. GENDRY gets up, insulted. He walks the length
         of the hall to exit, but DAENERYS notices him as he passes the head table.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Gendry.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY stops and faces her. The hall goes even quieter.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> That's right, isn't it?</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY approaches DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Yes, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> You're Robert Baratheon's son.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> (nods)</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I don't know, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Does anyone?</p>
      
      
      <p>No one in the hall responds.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span>I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.</p>
      
      
      <p>The crowd murmurs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I can't be. I'm a bastard.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.
         Because that is what I have made you.</p>
      
      
      <p>The newly named GENDRY BARATHEON nods in shock and surprise. At a nearby table, DAVOS
         stands and raises his glass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone in the hall rises to their feet to salute GENDRY.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">ALL</span> To Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Lord Gendry!</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 3</span> Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 4</span> Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY takes a goblet from the smiling JON SNOW.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 5</span> Lord Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY salutes the hall. They cheer in response.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 6</span> Gendry!</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND, still sitting, shakes his head and returns to shoveling food into his mouth.
         The hall contiunes to cheer.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 7</span> That's easy, isn't it?</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION; A fitting reward for a hero.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAM</span> (to GENDRY) Uh, hold on.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 8</span> (to GENDRY) Come, my lord.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> See? You're not the only one who's clever.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA looks at DAENERYS with concern, pondering the play that the Mother of Dragons
         has just made.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> I have to go down and get another barrel.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL GREAT HALL, LATER</p>
      
      
      <p>The mood has lightened. The merry crowd laughs and enjoys themselves. The wine flows
         freely. A server places a carafe of wine on the table in front of BRIENNE and JAIME.
         BRIENNE covers the top of her goblet but JAIME removes her hand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink,
         when is?</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself. BRIENNE watches, a bit nervous. They clink
         glasses and drink together.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS and TYRION stand talking about MELISANDRE.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm sure you had your reasons.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> I did. I do.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> So did you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light.
         We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs,
         no blessings. Who knows what he wants?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> And what if I'm not trying to be happy?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Thank you. I feel much better.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS takes the wine that TYRION has poured for him and drinks. TYRION exits.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE HOUND'S TABLE</p>
      
      
      <p>The celebrations are becoming raucous. THE HOUND takes the entire pitcher of wine
         from a serving wench as she passes.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: A FIREPLACE IN THE GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION looks into the fire, pensively.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> More ale!</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION address BRAN, who sits nearby.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years
         ago. I liked that one.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> I'm not Lord of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRAN doesn't answer.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You don't want it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> I don't really want anymore.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I envy you.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRAN looks turns to look behind him at MAESTER WOLKAN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.</p>
      
      
      <p>MAESTER WOLKAN steps up behind BRAN's chair and starts wheeling him away."</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND goads JON into drinking from his horn.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> All of it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Go on.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> No, not in one go.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Go on. I believe in you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> We have to celebrate our victory.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Vomiting is not celebrating.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Yes, it is.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone laughs. TORMUND holds up the drinking horn in salute.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Ah! To the Dragon Queen!</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone in the hall cheers. DAENERYS stands.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone stands and cheers again, even louder. Only THE HOUND remains seated in disdain
         for the celebration.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">ALL</span> Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> Drink!</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND tips the great horn back and drinks for an inordinately long time. He roars.
         JON and SANSA smile. SANSA watches DAENERYS again, then stands and exits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> I'm fine!</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS returns to her seat, sitting alone while TORMUND continues to spur on the
         drunken revelry nearby. The hall is abuzz with merriment.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: A NEARBY TABLE</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK are playing TYRION's drinking game.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> (drunkenly) Your turn.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> (to BRIENNE) Um, You are an only child.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I told you I was.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You didn't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I did.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I surmised it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>Humorously scoffing, BRIENNE drinks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Go again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Why does he get to go again?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Because it's my game.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You have danced with Renly Baratheon.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE looks accusingly at PODRICK.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> (to Brienne) No.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE HEAD TABLE</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND is quite drunk and vociferous as he celebrates with JON, DAVOS, and some Free
         Folk.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> The other way around!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> I saw him riding that thing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> We all did.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> No. No. I saw him riding that thing.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON, sitting behind him, shakes his head and laughs. He takes another drink as he
         listens.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> That's right, you did.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> I did. That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is.</p>
      
      
      <p>Sitting just beyond the group, DAENERYS notices the praise that JON is getting. She
         watches closely. TORMUND puts his hand of JON's shoulder with drunken affection. He
         then throws his arm around JON's shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> (laughing) He's little but he's strong. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get
         murdered for it!</p>
      
      
      <p>DAERNERYS continues to jealously observe the adulation that JON receives. A coffee
         cup rests on the table next to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Most people get bloody murdered, they stay that way.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND firmly slaps JON on the back. JON winces in pain.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Not this one.</p>
      
      
      <p>The men laugh.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Ah! He comes back and keeps fighting. Here, north of the Wall, and then back here
         again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS grows more unhappy with the praise and attention that JON is getting.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> He climbed on a fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking
         dragon? A madman or a king!</p>
      
      
      <p>The crowd cheers. JON looks at DAENERYS. She toasts him with her glass. TORMUND continues
         to laugh as DAENERYS looks around the room, with VARYS standing in the wings behind
         her. She looks over at the table where the drinking game is being played by TYRION,
         JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE drinks. They all laugh.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS looks back at JON and TORMUND, feeling let out. She stands quickly. VARYS
         stands in response. As she exits, VARYS bows to her, then watches her go with concern.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE DRINKING GAME</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION, JAIME, BRIENNE, and PODRICK are deep in their cups.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE and TYRION laugh. TYRION drinks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Mm!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> You were married. Before Sansa.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION growls and drinks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> You're drinking wine, but you prefer ale!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> No!</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION laughs drunkenly, and BRIENNE drinks, smiling. TYRION stares at BRIENNE as
         he prepares his next guess in their game, his face suddenly very serious.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You're a virgin.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE's face falls. PODRICK drinks nervously. JAIME tries to save the mood.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> That's a statement about the present.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> At no point in the past, up until this very moment, have you slept with a man. Or
         a woman.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE goes from flabbergasted to angry in the course a moment. She stands.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I have to piss.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND approaches them</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> We did it! We faced those icy fucks. Looked right into their blue eyes, and here
         we are. Now, which one of you cowards shit in my pants?</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND guffaws.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Please pardon me for a moment.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE exits, and the drunken TORMUND moves to follow. JAIME stands quickly and blocks
         him. They exchange a look. JAIME jovially pats TORMUND on the shoulder to stay him,
         then turns to follow BRIENNE. Wounded, TORMUND watches BRIENNE leave, tailed by JAIME.
         TYRION gets his attention by pouring his wine into TORMUND's drinking horn.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Drink it!</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION's eyes hold TORMUND's gaze as he clinks his glass with the drinking horn. He
         exits and PODRICK smirks. TORMUND digests the reality of the situation. He returns
         to his Free Folk friends. PODRICK watches him go, and his eyes meet those of a Stark
         maiden, who smiles at him. He smiles back.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE GREAT HALL, LATER</p>
      
      TORMUND, confessional and teary, pours his heart out to THE HOUND.
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me. Just takes her,
         like that. I mean it, Clegane. My heart is broken.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND clasps THE HOUND's shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Don't touch me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WILLA</span> You can touch me.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND swivels quickly to find WILLA and SARRA standing nearby.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WILLA</span> I'm not afraid of wildlings.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Maybe you should be.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA watches their interaction from afar. TORMUND chuckles and hugs WILLA close to
         him</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TORMUND</span> Well, Clegane, it's time to drown our sorrows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> I'm not done with my drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND sighs and grabs the pitcher from WILLA. He sets it down on a nearby table.
         They exit.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> You saved the day.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> You owe me one. Don't forget that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> For the rest of my days.</p>
      
      
      <p>While THE HOUND drains his glass and plunks it on the table, SARRA walks to the other
         side of him and sits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SARRA</span> Are you ready now?</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND grabs a large pitcher from the table in front of him and refills his glass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">HOUND</span> This is my drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>SARRA looks across the room to SANSA. She tries to re-engage THE HOUND, but he lurches
         aggressively at her, growling. SARRA recoils, then exits quickly</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> All right!</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA approaches THE HOUND and sits down across from him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> She could have made you happy, for a little while.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> There's only one thing that'll make me happy.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And what's that?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> That's my fucking business.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA returns his brush off with silence.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Used to be you couldn't look at me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> That was a long time ago. I've seen much worse than you since then.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And he got what he deserved. I gave it to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> How?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Hounds.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> You've changed, Little Bird.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND takes a deep drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> None of it would have happened if you'd left King's Landing with me. No Littlefinger,
         no Ramsay none of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA clasps his hand, gently. He looks down at the kindness, then back at her eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all
         my life.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA gathers herself, stands and exits. THE HOUND ponders.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: WINTERFELL COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>The rowdiness continues to increase, as the party spills out into the courtyard</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Hey!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Pour another one.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY searches for ARYA. He enters a passageway away from the festivities. He is
         startled by an arrow that pierces the wall just in front of his face. He turns to
         see ARYA holding the bow. He raises both hands in surrender, and enters.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Don't shoot.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA notches another bow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating
         with them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I am celebrating.</p>
      
      
      <p>She launches the arrow at a makeshift target tacked to a barrel. She picks up another
         arrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Yeah, I am too. I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore. I'm Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's
         End. By order of the queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Congratulations.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY grabs her quickly and kisses her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know
         is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if
         you're not with me. So be with me.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY kneels before ARYA</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Be my wife. Be the Lady of Storm's End.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA bends down and kisses GENDRY. They stand together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You'll be a wonderful lord, and any lady would be lucky to have you. But I'm not
         a lady. I never have been. That's not me.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA readies another arrow, and lets it fly.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE adds a log to the fire burning in the hearth. There is a knock on the door.
         BRIENNE walks over and opens it. JAIME stands at, leaning drunkenly against the wall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You didn't drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME invites himself in. He places a pitcher on the table, and grabs the two glasses
         nestled the elbow of his right arm. BRIENNE is a bit confused, but she closes the
         door and walks over.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I didn't drink?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> In the game.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I drank.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME picks up the pitcher to pour a glass of wine.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> In the game. This is Dornish.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> This is not the game. This is only drinking.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME hands her a full glass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Suit yourself.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE drinks, a puzzled look on her face.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You keep it warm enough in here.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME slides off his jacket with a bit of difficulty and throws it down on the table.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> It's the first thing I learnt when I came to the North. Keep your fire going. Every
         time you leave the room, put more wood on.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> That's very diligent. Very responsible.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Piss off.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> It grows on you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I don't want things growing on me.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME fills the other glass with a sloppy pour.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME drinks. BRIENNE's expression softens.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME works to undo the lacing of his shirt, but struggles to do so one-handed. He
         chuckles in embarrassment at his ineptitude. He tries using his left hand and his
         teeth. BRIENNE realizes that this is a drunken seduction. She swats his hand away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Oh, move aside.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE undoes JAIME's shirt. He starts doing the same for her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> What are you doing?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'm taking your shirt off.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both pause and look at one another. BRIENNE undoes her own shirt as he watches.
         She helps JAIME pull his shirt over his head. She then peels off her own shirt.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I've never slept with a knight before.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I've never slept with anyone before.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Then you have to drink. Those are the rules.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I told you-</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME cuts her short with a hungry kiss. She returns in kind.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: JON'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>JON sits on the edge of his bed, his head propped up on one fist, tired and drunk.
         DAENERYS opens the door and enters.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Are you drunk?</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at her for a beat.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> No.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON stands and stumbles a bit. He laughs at himself.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Only a little.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS shuts the door and moves closer.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die,
         it would have been protecting you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> He loved me. And I couldn't love him back. Not the way he wanted. Not the way I love
         you.</p>
      
      
      <p>They embrace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Is that all right?</p>
      
      
      <p>JON and DAENERYS kiss, gently at first. Their passion builds and they start to undress
         one another while still kissing. JON pulls back, a conflicted look on his face. DAENERYS
         responds with dejection. JON moves away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I wish you'd never told me. If I didn't know, I'd be happy right now.</p>
      
      
      <p>She sits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you.
         I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at
         me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I told you I don't want it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North.
         What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?</p>
      
      
      <p>JON kneels before her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS quickly takes JON's face in her hands and looks him straight in the eye.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> (desperately) You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really
         are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it
         will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does
         to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON stands. DAENERYS takes his hand in hers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I want it to be the way it was between us.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON returns her touch.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I have to tell Sansa and Arya.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> She won't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've
         done to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I owe them the truth.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Even if the truth destroys us?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> It won't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON cups her face in his hands.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS's face turns stony.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> We can. I've just told you how.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON lets his hands fall. DAENERYS walks away.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE and JAIME lie in bed, naked. BRIENNE is fast asleep. JAMIE looks at her, breathes
         deeply, then stares towards the ceiling.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: WINTERFELL WAR ROOM, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>The room contains a map of Westeros with stone pieces representing the forces at Winterfell
         and King's Landing. The war council consists of MISSANDEI, DAENERYS, VARYS, GREY WORM,
         TYRION, JON, ARYA, SANSA, QHONO, SAM, BRAN, MAESTER WOLKAN, DAVOS, and BRIENNE. The
         mood is somber and tense.</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM picks up a handful of Winterfell markers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GREY WORM</span> Half are gone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> The Northmen as well.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON slides of some other markers. MAESTER WOLKAN slides away some more. VARYS places
         additional markers in King's Landing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.
         The balance has grown distressingly even.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MISSANDEI</span> When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her
         out root and stem.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands
         in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,
         she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry,
         and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei
         aside.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons
         will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them
         in the field.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS pauses and thinks before responding.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> All right.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better
         if they have time to rest and recuperate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> How long do you suggest?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that
         the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not
         ready to fight?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> The longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance
         to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns to face DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What you command, we will obey.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA and SANSA exchange a glance.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the
         Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON moves the corresponding markers on the map.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone
         with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above.</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM moves those markers into position.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men
         will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone exits, except for the Stark children. ARYA intercepts JON as he begins to
         leave. SANSA moves to stand beside BRAN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> We need a word.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: WINTERFELL GODSWOOD, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>The Stark children discuss the situation in the godswood.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to
         King's Landing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Arya's the one that killed the Night King.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone
         who-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I swore myself and the North to her cause.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I respect that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You respect it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're
         doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You don't know her yet.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I'll never know her. She's not one of us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> That's all right. I don't need many allies.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Arya-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I've never been a Stark.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON hesitates.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> It's your choice.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA and ARYA look to BRAN, confused.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> What is it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You have to swear it, before I tell you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Because we're family. Swear it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I swear it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> I swear it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> (to BRAN) Tell them.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA and ARYA turn to BRAN.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: WINTERFELL HOUSE, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>Two cloaked people walk by the modest house.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: WINTERFELL HOUSE</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME and TYRION talk by the fire.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> So she's going to stay here with you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb
         for it.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both laugh.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall person jokes? To climbing mountains.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION and JAIME clink their glasses in a toast.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> To climbing mountains.</p>
      
      
      <p>They drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> What's she like down there?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What? That's not your concern.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You're a dog.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I am the Imp, and I demand to know.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN enters. He cavalierly holds JOFFREY's crossbow</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall blond toffs. Must be like looking in
         the mirror.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Where's your drink? What are you, what are you doing
         up North?</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME motions to the crossbow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What are you doing with that?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You're supposed to be south.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN sits next to them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> That's a bit rude.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Year after year, I've shoveled Lannister shit, and what do I have to show?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You're a knight, thanks to me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blonde hair from your brother's
         ballsack.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Power resides where men believe-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Shut your mouth.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm just trying-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all-</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN pivots in his seat and gives TYRION a left hook to the face. JAIME jerks to
         his feet. In a fluid motion, BRONN leans back and threatens JAIME with the crossbow</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are
         long gone.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION tips his head back and groans, holding his nose with both hands.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You broke my nose!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> I did not break your nose.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> How do you know?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds
         like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty
         of peasants who do what they're told.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> And you trust Cersei-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be
         torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens
         I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN picks up a cup of wine and drinks deeply.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up
         dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> May I speak?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Why not? Only death will shut you up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Highgarden? Are you mad?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It's better than being dead.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if-</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN unleashes a crossbow bolt just past JAIME's head. They both are taken by surprise
         and go silent at the threat. BRONN reloads.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk?
         They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With
         a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make
         you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking
         grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN takes another drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Highgarden. Give me your word.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> The glory is yours, my queen.</p>

         and our child shall one day rule them all.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON rises, and looks to QYBURN, who nods, confirming CERSEI's pregnancy. Elated,
         EURON stokes CERSEI affectionately. She does not enjoy it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> She's coming for you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have
         to murder thousands of innocent people first.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI moves away from the window and walks past SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE,
         who guards MISSANDEI, hands shackled and weeping.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever
         thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> You saw my child fall from the sky.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the
         Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei
         is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect.
         I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what
         you have always struggled to defeat.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from
         tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing.
         In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne.
         If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people
         see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister
         refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them.</p>

         How could she not believe in destiny?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to
         save us all.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And how do you know she wasn't?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know
         them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION pours himself some wine.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> We're discussing treason.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords
         of Westeros, whose support we are going to need.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd
         agree.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm
         afraid.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.
         Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven
         Kingdoms.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> You've always known my reasons.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Even if you know it's a mistake?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal
         advisers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't
         care who sits on the Iron Throne.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne.
         We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to
         live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter
         the personal cost.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> So, what happens to her?</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS looks at TYRION with a knowing lock, not putting into words the unspeakable.
         TYRION shakes his head.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Please. Don't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose
         wisely.</p>

      <p>JAIME enters the courtyard. He looks over at SANSA, BRIENNE, and MAESTER WOLKAN, who
         are engaged in conversation. WOLKAN exits one way and SANSA and BRIENNE leave in another.
         JAIME follows them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN 2</span> It's really heavy, mind you.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What happened?</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA and BRIENNE exchange a glance. SANSA nods, giving BRIENNE permission to tell
         JAIME the news.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed,

      <p>INT: BRIENNE'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME sits awake and and fully dressed at the foot of the bed. BRIENNE lies sleeping.
         He tries to slip away quietly, but the sound of his exit wakes BRIENNE. She sits up,
         alarmed, looking for him.</p>

      <p>BRIENNE takes JAIME's face in her hands, pleading with him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good
         man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me.
         (voice breaking) Please. Stay.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life
         for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I
         would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei.</p>

         with her tears.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS, GREY WORM, DAENERYS, and TYRION stand in front of a phalanx of Unsullied soldiers.
         High above them, CERSEI, EURON, and THE MOUNTAIN look down upon them from atop the
         gate. MISSANDEI stands with them, shackled and frightened. They are flanked by a long
         line of scorpions that are loaded, manned, and ready. The small company of Unsullied
         are vastly outnumbered by the archers and soldiers of King's Landing. An Unsullied
         solder shouts and the company thump their spears to attention.</p>
      
      
      <p>The gate rattles and QYBURN walks out. TYRION steps forward to meet him halfway between
         the gate and the Unsullied.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> My lord.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release
         of Missandei of Naath.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei
         of Naath will die here and now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Qyburn, you're a rational man.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Or so I flatter myself, my lord.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Yes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of
         children burning alive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> No, it is not a pleasant sound.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I- I don't want to hear it. Help me save this city.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Your queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies
         are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan-</p>
      
      
      <p>Having heard enough, TYRION walks past QYBURN so that he can address CERSEI directly.
         As he approaches the wall, The Kingsguard respond to the thread.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CAPTAIN</span> Ready! Nock! Draw!</p>
      
      
      <p>The scores of archers draw their bows back, aiming at TYRION. The Imp continues to
         approach until he is within shouting distance. Looking down on him with contempt,
         CERSEI raises her hand, ready to give the order to her soldiers. After a tense moment,
         she makes a fist and brings her arm gently to her side. Her men stand down. TYRION
         nods, grateful.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate
         them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've
         always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything.
         I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that
         doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI weighs his words. DAENERYS looks on, anxious and angry. CERSEI steps forward
         next to MISSANDEI and clutches her arm. In response, DAENERYS and GREY WORM move closer.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time.</p>
      
      
      <p>MISSANDEI stares below for a moment and takes a few shuddering breaths before raising
         her eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MISSANDEI</span> Dracarys.</p>
      
      
      <p>Horror and disbelief shows on the faces of DAENERYS and GREY WORM. TYRION mouths "No".
         CERSEI smiles cruelly. She looks to THE MOUNTAIN, who steps forward, drawing his great
         sword. He slices through MISSANDEI's neck in one sweeping cut. Her head and body fall
         from the top of the gate to the ground below. GREY WORM turns away, unable to watch.
         His face twitches and he breathes raggedly.</p>
      
      
      <p>Atop the wall, CERSEI looks down, satisfied. EURON looks pleased. TYRION turns around,
         dejected. He looks at DAENERYS, who struggles to contain her anger. TYRION knows he
         has failed her. CERSEI savors her cruel moment. DAENERYS fumes and boils with fury
         as she walks away through the Unsullied.</p>
