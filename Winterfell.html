      <h1>EPISODE 1 - WINTERFELL</h1>
      
      
      <p>TITLE SEQUENCE</p>
      
      <p>EXT. WINTER TOWN - DAY</p>
      
      <p>A young boy runs through a snowy forest woods, he crosses a shallow stream and then
         runs through the streets of the winter town. As he runs through the town, pigs squeal
         and donkeys bray. He reaches the street and stands among a large crowd, struggling
         to see what is happening on the road. A man steps aside and the boy pushes through.
         Pan up to see ARYA STARK smiling as she watches the boy run through. A large army
         is marching along the road and the boy continues to run alongside them. He finds a
         tree and climbs up it to get a good view. Pan up to see the army marching along the
         road from the winter town up to Winterfell. A man's shout can be heard, and the boy
         turns to face the rear of the army. Pan around to see the large army of DAENERYS TARGARYEN.
         Cut to the middle of the army marching through the streets, DAENERYS and JON SNOW
         atop their horses. Cut to ARYA, she looks at JON and smiles, she starts to speak but
         says nothing as he rides by. Many people of the town stare at the troops marching
         through. SANDOR "THE HOUND" CLEGANE is on a horse of his own with the army. ARYA sees
         him but says nothing. GENDRY is also riding on a horse, ARYA looks at him and smiles
         as he goes past.</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE</p>
      
      
      <p>A carriage is among the army and it carries within it TYRION LANNISTER who sits opposite
         LORD VARYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Because I have balls, and you don't.</p>
      
      
      <p>The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other.
         The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at JON and DAENERYS
         as they ride past.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.</p>
      
      
      <p>A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring
         as DAENERYS' dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. ARYA emerges from the crowd
         smiling. The dragons swoop over Winterfell and SANSA STARK watches them fly overhead
         from the walls of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL '“ FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS and JON ride into Winterfell towards a crowd of people standing within. BRAN
         STARK is sitting at the front of the crowd. JON rides up to him and dismounts his
         horse. He walks up to BRAN and kisses him on the forehead.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Look at you.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON sniffles.</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You're a man.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> Almost.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at him quizzically and then up to SANSA who is standing next to him. He
         walks up to her and gives her a hug. JORAH MORMONT and DAENERYS watch from behind.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Where's Arya?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Lurking somewhere.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns around to DAENERYS and she walks over to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as
         your brother claimed, as are you.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA looks at DAENERYS hesitantly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS turns to look at BRAN.</p>
      
      <span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.
      
      <p>SANSA, DAENERYS and JON all look at each other concerned.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL '“ LARGE HALL</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell.
         Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?</p>
      
      
      <p>A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Umber">UMBER</span> We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.</p>
      
      
      <p>He stops and then turns to look at JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Umber">UMBER</span> And my lord.</p>
      
      
      <p>He stops again and then turns to look at DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Umber">UMBER</span> And my queen. Sorry.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people
         here.</p>
      
      
      <p>UMBER bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning
         the castles anymore. We make our stand here.</p>
      
      <span class="speaker">MAESTER WOLKAN</span> At once, Your Grace.
      
      <p>WOLKAN exits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA MORMONT</span> "Your Grace."</p>
      
      
      <p>LYANNA stands up and walks forwards</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure
         what you are now.</p>
      
      
      <p>People start murmuring.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> A lord? Nothing at all?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> It's not important.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> Not important? We named you King in the North.</p>
      
      
      <p>People start cheering.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> King of the North!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith.
         But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought
         those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect
         the North. I chose the North.</p>
      
      
      <p>People murmur. TYRION stands up and walks to the centre of the room.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life
         to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the
         greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And
         soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.</p>
      
      
      <p>People grumble and yell out indistinctly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together
         now or die.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While
         I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied
         and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Whatever they want.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon
         and GENDRY catches it before it hits the ground.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Sorry 'bout that.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY climbs into the back of one of the wagons.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Are these the last of the wagons?</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera cuts to TYRION who is watching over the courtyard.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Aye.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> All right, let's get it all to the forges.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION walks up to SANSA and YOHN ROYCE.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> My lord. My lady.</p>
      
      
      <p>ROYCE turns to look at SANSA, who nods back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Royce">ROYCE</span> My lady.</p>
      
      
      <p>ROYCE exits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> It had its moments.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARATHEON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Apologies for leaving like that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> We both survived.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.</p>
      
      
      <p>There is a short silence.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have
         every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise,
         you'll be safe-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She did.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And you believed her?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA exits and TYRION turns to see BRAN staring at him from the courtyard.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD</p>
      
      
      <p>JON stands next to the weirwood tree and looks at the face carved into the trunk</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You used to be taller.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns around to see ARYA standing near him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> How did you sneak up on me?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> How did you survive a knife through the heart?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I didn't.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their
         hug, JON looks down to see ARYA's sword and scoffs in disbelief.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You still have it.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA unsheathes her sword.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Needle.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Have you ever used it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Once or twice.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA puts Needle away. JON pulls out his sword, Longclaw, and hands it to ARYA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Valyrian steel.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Jealous?</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA scoffs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Too heavy for me.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON sheaths his sword and puts his hand on ARYA's shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> She doesn't like your queen, does she?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> She's the smartest person I've ever met.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Now you're defending her?</p>
      
      
      <p>JON chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I'm defending our family. So is she.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Yeah. I'm her family too.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA hugs JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Don't forget that.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT '“ KING'S LANDING - DAY</p>
      
      <p>Pan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to CERSEI LANNISTER
         who stares out at the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI's lips curl.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Good.</p>
      
      
      <p>She exits as the camera pans around. EURON GREYJOY's Iron Fleet is out at sea and
         QYBURN turns to look out at them.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON smiles and stares out at King's Landing from his ship. He walks in the cabin</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO EURON'S SHIP - CABIN</p>
      
      <p>EURON walks inside and past YARA GREYJOY who is tied to a post in the cabin.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON walks up to her and crouches down.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON chuckles and pops the lid off his drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?</p>
      
      
      <p>He sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> Are we in King's Landing?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Mm.</p>
      
      
      <p>He turns and offers his drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> You picked the losing side.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.</p>
      
      
      <p>He stands up and turns to look her in the eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON exits.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: RED KEEP '“ GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, EURON and HARRY STRICKLAND stand opposite her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Twenty-thousand men, is it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Strickland">HARRY</span> Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters.
         You won't miss them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Horses?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Strickland">HARRY</span> Two thousand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> And elephants?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Strickland">HARRY</span> Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Strickland">HARRY</span> They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Strickland">HARRY</span> We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>HARRY bows and exits.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Am I most welcome here?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Good. As a true friend and an honored guest</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON starts to walk forward but GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE steps in the way. EURON
         stops but leans towards CERSEI.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> I was hoping we could talk in private.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> After the war. That was our agreement.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Wars sometimes last years.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI stands and starts to walk out.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> How?</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI stops.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of
         affection. My heart is nearly broken.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI turns around to face EURON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You're insolent. I've executed men for less.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> They were lesser men.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI walks towards the door but halts. She turns around and looks at EURON. EURON
         chuckles and follows CERSEI, staring at THE MOUNTAIN as he walks past.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN is on a bed in brothel with three women around him, DIRAH, CRAYAH and MAREI.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> Burnt up some of my favorite boys.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> Archie, was it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> And William.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> Tall handsome William?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> Yeah, tall handsome William.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Nearly killed it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAREI</span> That's brave.</p>
      
      
      <p>MAREI pushes BRONN back and climbs on top of him, CRAYAH and DIRAH climb on the bed
         either side.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> That boy Eddie.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> The ginger?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DIRAH</span> How does he sleep with no eyelids?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN sits up and all four of them look at QYBURN who is standing in the doorway.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> You're kidding me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN sighs and removes MAREI from his lap.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN stands up and starts dressing himself. CRAYAH walks up to QYBURN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">CRAYAH</span> You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.</p>
      
      
      <p>The three women leave.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRONN chokes on his drink and coughs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Which girl?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify
         their mistake.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays
         in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon
         just outside.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon
         Queen she's after-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> Yeah, well, good luck with that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the
         event that they do-</p>
      
      
      <p>A guard brings in a large crossbow, the one that TYRION had previously used to murder
         his, JAIME's, and CERSEI's father, TYWIN LANNISTER.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> She has a keen sense of poetic justice.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stokeworth">BRONN</span> That fucking family.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange
         for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids
         her of her treasonous brothers?</p>
      
      
      <p>QYBURN walks up to BRONN and holds out the crossbow. After a short silence, BRONN
         takes it. QYBURN exits whilst BRONN looks at the crossbow in his hands.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: RED KEEP - CERSEI'S QUARTERS</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI is standing behind a chair and sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> I wanted those elephants.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans to reveal EURON getting dressed. He sighs and CERSEI walks around
         the chair and sits down.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> So, how do I compare to the fat king?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You're insulting my late husband?</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON walks up to her and whispers in her ear.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Are you offended?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around
         a woman's body.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> And the Kingslayer?</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI glares at EURON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Life is boring.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You're not boring, I'll give you that.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON smiles and walks up to CERSEI, standing over her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Do I please the queen?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> But now I want to be alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON leans down and speaks softly to CERSEI.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> I'm going to put a prince in your belly.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON exits and tears start to form in CERSEI's eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: IRON FLEET</p>
      
      
      <p>A door can be heard open and then close, a bow string creaks and then an arrow pierces
         a man's head. More and more of EURON's men drop dead and a group of men walk over
         their bodies. YARA is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears
         a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. THEON GREYJOY
         walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties YARA. THEON helps YARA to her feet
         before she turns to him and headbutts him. THEON falls to the floor, stunned, and
         YARA extends a hand. THEON grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THEON'S SHIPS</p>
      
      
      <p>Three ships from the Iron Fleet sail together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men
         and his ships.</p>
      
      
      <p>YARA and THEON stand on deck next to one another.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> We can take our home back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> Daenerys went north.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the
         dead can't go.</p>
      
      
      <p>THEON pauses and sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> You're my queen. I go where you command.</p>
      
      
      <p>YARA turns to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">YARA</span> You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never
         die.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> What is dead may never die.</p>

      <p>DAENERYS' army are camped outside the walls of Winterfell and wagons and horses enter
         the front gate.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL '“ FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>Inside the gate, WOLKAN is greeting ALYS KARSTARK as the KARSTARKS arrive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Bolton">WOLKAN</span> Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me</p>
      
      
      <p>WOLKAN and ALYS exit, VARYS, DAVOS SEAWORTH and TYRION are watching on.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> The Karstarks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Can't argue with that.</p>
      
      
      <p>The three men start walking with each other.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the
         battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And our queen is grateful.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow,
         not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a
         while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you
         have to earn it.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION stops and thinks. He then catches up with DAVOS and VARYS who continued to
         walk.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I sense that you're leading to a proposal.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS looks out over the castle wall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King,
         what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a
         just woman and an honorable man?</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS and TYRION walk forward to look over the wall with DAVOS, they see JON and DAENERYS
         standing and talking with each other.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> They do make a handsome couple.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old
         men.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm not that old.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Not as old as him.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Our queen respects the wisdom of age.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind
         them of an unpleasant truth.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> What is that?</p>

      <p>JON and DAENERYS walk together as men shout indistinctly in the background.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your sister doesn't like me.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both stop and turn to one another.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either
         when we were growing up.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki)</span> How many today?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">DOTHRAKI MAN #1</span> Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Dothraki men ride away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON (speaking the Common Tongue)</span> What's the matter?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> The dragons are barely eating.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS walks off and JON follows.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT. FLAT CLEARING</p>
      
      <p>JON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile
         of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What's wrong with them?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> They don't like the North.</p>
      
      
      <p>She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at JON and gets close. DAENERYS climbs
         on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Go on.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I don't know how to ride a dragon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What if he doesn't want me to?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.</p>
      
      
      <p>Defeated, JON walks around the side of RHAEGAL and then climbs on top whilst grunting.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What do I hold onto?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Whatever you can.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. DAENERYS
         watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons
         continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing JON to yell out. They fly
         over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past TYRION, DAVOS and VARYS who are standing
         at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL
         and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue
         calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying
         along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so DAENERYS instructs
         DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to JON. JON and DAENERYS, now dismounted
         from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> You've completely ruined horses for me.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS giggles and then notices a large waterfall, they stop.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> We could stay a thousand years-</p>
      
      
      <p>She turns back to look at JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> No one would find us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We'd be pretty old.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS chuckles and the two walk up to one another.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> It's cold up here for a southern girl.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> So keep your queen warm.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing JON to
         pull away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Don't be afraid.</p>
      
      
      <p>They smile and continue their kiss in each other's embrace. JON opens his eyes to
         see DROGON staring at them.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT. WINTERFELL '“ DAY</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY amongst other men occupy the forge, using the furnaces to create weapons from
         dragonglass</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Gendry?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> He's here.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY hears and grabs a large axe made from dragonglass. He hands it over to SANDOR.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> You're saying you're good, is that it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one
         are you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Leave him be.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY and SANDOR turn to see ARYA and stare at her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> I heard you were here. You left me to die.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> First I robbed you.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANDOR stands up and walks over to her, not breaking eye-contact.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANDOR exits and GENDRY walks up to ARYA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Yeah, thanks. So have you.</p>
      
      
      <p>He pauses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I mean, you look good.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Thanks. So do you.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY pauses, he then walks away whilst still talking to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA follows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Stay close to that forge, then.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Is that a command, Lady Stark?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Don't call me that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> As you wish, milady.</p>
      
      
      <p>She smiles and chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Here's my wish.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA hands GENDRY a piece of parchment with a detachable spear drawn on it, with a
         dragonglass tip.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Can you make it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> What do you need something like this for?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Can you make it or not?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> You already have a sword. What's that?</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA removes a Valyrian steel dagger from her person and hands it to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA smirks and takes the dagger back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You don't know any other rich girls.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA walks off before turning back and smiling and then back around again without
         breaking stride.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL '“ SANSA'S QUARTERS</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA is reading a letter when there is a knock on the door.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Come in.</p>
      
      
      <p>The door creaks open and then shuts. JON walks in before stopping next to her. SANSA
         sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> "House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't
         that what he said?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA stands up and walks a bit before stopping and turning to look at him</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> "The King in the North."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I told you we needed allies.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies
         home with me, two dragons.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And a Targaryen queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa.
         Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
         Without her, we don't stand a chance.</p>
      
      
      <p>They fall silent and JON sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Do you have any faith in me at all?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You know I do.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> No, she's much prettier.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON scoffs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?</p>
      
      
      <p>He looks up at her.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY</p>
      
      
      <p>A door creaks open and then shuts as DAENERYS and JORAH enter the library. They walk
         to where SAMWELL TARLY sits and JORAH nods in his direction. DAENERYS clears her throat.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Oh!</p>
      
      
      <p>Startled, SAMWELL stands up and dusts himself off.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> So you're the man?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> They could, they just wouldn't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service
         merits a great reward.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Well, there must be something I could give you.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL nods.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> For what crime?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.</p>
      
      
      <p>JORAH and DAENERYS both smile to themselves.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> And also a sword.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS looks at him, confused.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> From the Citadel?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS' face drops and she looks concerned.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Not Randyll Tarly?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> You know him?</p>
      
      
      <p>He looks at her, surprised. JORAH looks guilty.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.</p>
      
      
      <p>JORAH looks down as SAMWELL tried to hold it together. He gulps.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS' face is stern.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your brother stood with your father.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL's lips start quivering and his breath becomes shaky.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Of course.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL exits quickly, and DAENERYS and JORAH look at each other.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL heads outside before being startled by a horse carrying a wagon. He stops
         and sees BRAN staring at him from across the courtyard. He walks over.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> What are you doing out here?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL shakes his head.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS</p>
      
      
      <p>JON blows out a candle and stands back to look at his father, EDDARD STARK's, statue.
         He sighs and hears a man grunting and a thud. He walks around the corner to see SAMWELL
         stand up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Sam?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON grabs SAMWELL and hugs him tightly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Were you hiding from me?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Of course not.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?</p>
      
      
      <p>He looks at SAMWELL's face and sees he is worried.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> She's good.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Little Sam?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Don't you know?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Know what?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at SAMWELL, shocked at the news he is hearing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> She didn't tell you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Would you have done it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I wasn't a king.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> But you were. You've always been.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I gave up my crown, Sam.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON starts walking away, SAMWELL follows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody
         Seven Kingdoms.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON stops immediately, pauses and turns around.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What are you talking about?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Your mother was Lyanna Stark.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON exhales sharply.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard.
         You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot
         to take in.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON walks up to SAMWELL</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all
         my life.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you.
         And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon
         Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON takes a couple of steps back whilst breathing heavily.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Daenerys is our queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> She shouldn't be.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> That's treason.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT. LAST HEARTH - NIGHT</p>
      
      <p>BERIC DONDARRION and TORMUND with a group of others walk into Last Hearth to find
         it deserted. BERIC enters the building first, the others following cautiously behind.
         While exploring a dark hallway, a sudden noise startles the group and they press themselves
         against the walls, weapons drawn as the sounds turn into footprints. Suddenly, TORMUND
         leaps around the corner to confront the source of the noise with a roar, the rest
         of the group yelling in preparation to attack the enemy, but instead they find DOLOROUS
         EDD and others of the Night's Watch.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> Stay back, he's got blue eyes!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> I've always had blue eyes!</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone pauses and lowers their weapons with sighs of relief.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> Did you find anyone?</p>
      
      
      <p>EDD leads BERIC and TORMUND through a large hall, faintly illuminated by BERIC's ignited
         sword. When they reach the far wall there is a young boy impaled on the wall with
         several spirals of limbs surrounding him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> The Umber boy.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> It's a message. From the Night King.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.</p>
      
      
      <p>UMBER's eyes open.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-</p>
      
      
      <p>UMBER starts shrieking, the three men start clamoring and BERIC shoves his sword in
         the boy, both igniting him and causing him to shriek even louder. The shrieking eventually
         stops, but not before the entire mosaic of appendages has been engulfed by flames.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT. WINTER TOWN - DAY</p>
      
      <p>Men are marching along the long road up to Winterfell, a cloaked figure rides a horse.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL</p>
      
      
      <p>The cloaked man rides the horse up to the stable and dismounts as men around shout
         indistinctly. He removes his hood and JAIME LANNISTER's face is revealed. He sighs
         and looks around the courtyard before BRAN catches his eye. JAIME stares at him in
         disbelief at the camera zooms in on BRAN's face.</p>
