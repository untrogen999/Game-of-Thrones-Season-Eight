        <p> This is an image of the Game of Thrones Map called Westeros. It will help readers better following along the journeys of our beloved characters and familiarize themselves with the environment of where the chracaters are heading. Since GOT takes place over a huge area, finding a clear map was challenging, I recommend viewers to visit <a href="https://quartermaester.info">Quarter Maester</a> which is an interactive verison of the image provided. </p>
