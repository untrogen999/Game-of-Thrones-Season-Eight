      <h1>EPISODE 2 - A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS</h1>
      
      
      <p>TITLE SEQUENCE</p>
      
      <p>INT. WINTERFELL - DAY</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME LANNISTER stands in the Great Hall of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS TARGARYEN</span> When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered
         our father.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera cuts to a wide view of the hall and we see a multitude of guards placed
         around the room and the many who ally with House Stark. Sitting at the head of the
         room is DAENERYS in the centre of a long table; JON SNOW sits on her left and SANSA
         STARK on her right and JAIME is standing in the middle of the room facing DAENERYS.
         On the left of the room there is a shorter table where TYRION LANNISTER, LORD VARYS,
         MISSANDEI and JORAH MORMONT sit. On the right there is another table where DAVOS SEAWORTH,
         LYANNA MORMONT, LORD YOHN ROYCE, ALYS KARSTARK and BRIENNE OF TARTH sit</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and
         watched as his blood poured onto the floor.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME’s eyes lowered.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once
         we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.</p>
      
      
      <p>She pauses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your sister pledged to send her army north.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She did.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to
         me.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION looks up at his brother and JAIME looks back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS turned her glare towards TYRION.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos,
         bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy
         the survivors.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> "We"?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION steps forwards towards DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Your Grace, I know my brother-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Like you knew your sister?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that
         if he weren't telling the truth?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits
         my throat.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION looks to JON and SANSA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried
         to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for
         my house and my family. I'd do it all again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> The things we do for love.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS, SANSA and JON all turn slowly to look at BRAN who sits to the side of SANSA.
         JAIME looks at him and BRAN maintains eye-contact.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> So why have you abandoned your house and family now?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Because this goes beyond loyalty.</p>
      
      
      <p>He looks around to see BRIENNE, then turns back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> This is about survival.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS. BRIENNE then stands up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> You don't know me well, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>She walks from behind her table to stand in the middle of the Hall beside JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were
         both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime
         defended me. And lost his hand because of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>She then addresses SANSA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me
         to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA looks down and then back up at BRIENNE.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You vouch for him?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I do.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You would fight beside him?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I would.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> What does the Warden of the North say about it?</p>
      
      
      <p>She turns to JON who sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We need every man we can get.</p>
      
      
      <p>The room falls silent as DAENERYS thinks to herself.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Very well.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION exhales sharply in relief. GREY WORM picks up JAIME’s sword, walks over to
         him, handing it over aggressively.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Thank you, Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS stands up and the rest of the room does as she does. SANSA exits. DAENERYS
         turns to JON who exits after his sister. DAENERYS then exits followed by TYRION, VARYS,
         JORAH and MISSANDEI. JAIME then catches BRIENNE’s eye as she leaves and then he ends
         up looking at BRAN again who mimics his stare.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – HALLWAY</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS walks along the hallway outside the hall followed by TYRION, VARYS and JORAH.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know
         at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I was a fool.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Not for the first time.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS stops walking and turns to TYRION.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another
         Hand who can.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS exits. TYRION turns to VARYS and JORAH.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - FORGES</p>
      
      
      <p>Men chatter indistinctly as they forge the weapons. GENDRY walks into frame, dumping
         dragonglass out of a bucket. He then walks up to furnace and pulls out some dragonglass,
         moulding it and then dousing it in a bucket of water. ARYA STARK walks towards him.
         As the steam rises from the bucket she catches his eye.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Don't you have something better to do?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You make my weapon yet?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY hands her a small axe with a blade made of dragonglass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY grabs the axe and brings it down harshly on a wooden stump.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It's strong enough.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY moves to a pile of dragonglass spearheads and checks on it, ARYA follows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Are you going to be down in the crypt?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> No, but-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> But you're a fighter.</p>
      
      
      <p>He glances up at her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I've done my share.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You've fought them?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I did. Some of them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> How many?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> A few. That was enough.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> What are they like?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Bad. Really bad.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> "Really bad"?</p>
      
      
      <p>She walks behind him and around the other side of the table so she is facing him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad." What do they look like?
         What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers
         or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death.
         That's what they're like.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA picks up one of the spearheads, turning it in her hand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I know Death.</p>
      
      
      <p>She throws the spearhead, narrowly missing a blacksmith’s head. GENDRY exhales, staring
         in disbelief at the dragonglass impaled on the wooden beam.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> He's got many faces.</p>
      
      
      <p>She tosses another landing next to the first. The blacksmith quickly runs away. GENDRY
         slowly turns back to ARYA who picks up a third spearhead.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I look forward to seeing this one.</p>
      
      
      <p>She throws it and it lands with the first two. GENDRY chuckles to himself and ARYA
         walks back round the table and past GENDRY.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> My weapon?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I'll get right on it.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA walks off as GENDRY watches. He smirks to himself.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans from behind a tree to show BRAN sitting in his wheelchair facing the
         weirwood tree. JAIME walks towards him. He stops a couple feet from him and looks
         down.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'm sorry for what I did to you.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRAN turns his head towards JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME walks around in front of BRAN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'm not that person anymore.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still
         be Brandon Stark.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You're not?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> No. I'm something else now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You're not angry at me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> I'm not angry at anyone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Why didn't you tell them?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME nods and raises an eyebrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What about afterwards?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> How do you know there is an afterwards?</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME stares at BRAN.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>All of the Northerners are busy building defenses in preparation for the army of the
         dead as TYRION walks past. JAIME approaches him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Well, here we are.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Yes, here we are.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Together again.</p>
      
      
      <p>A man standing above them clears his throat and then spits on the floor beside them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And the masses rejoice.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> How do they feel about their new queen?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She's your new queen too.</p>
      
      
      <p>They start walking together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll
         come around once they see Daenerys is different.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> And she is? Different?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She is.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You're sure about her?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I am.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She didn't seem sure about you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated
         my opponents.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Hmm.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again.
         And I believed her.</p>
      
      
      <p>They stop walking and TYRION turns to look up at JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Was she lying about the baby too?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> No, that part is real.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION thinks to himself and they both start walking again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on
         yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.</p>
      
      
      <p>They start to walk up a staircase and TYRION turns to look at JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION walks ahead as JAIME remains in the same spot. After a couple seconds, he follows.
         They both walk along the walls of castle looking over the courtyard.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured
         myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">BOTH</span> A girl's mouth around-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Your cock.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> My cock.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION smiles up at JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying
         her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME notices something whilst TYRION continues to talk and walks off.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION glances up where JAIME was and notices he is gone, he looks behind to see JAIME
         looking over the wall. The camera cuts to show BRIENNE walking outside the walls among
         the Unsullied.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM is seen testing out the traps around the castle as other Unsullied and Northerners
         work around him. JAIME walks out the front gate. We see PODRICK PAYNE training with
         a soldier as BRIENNE watches on, smiling proudly. JAIME stands next to her and she
         glances at him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Ser Jaime.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Lady Brienne.</p>
      
      
      <p>PODRICK blocks the soldier and pushes him back, bettering him. They continue to fight
         with their swords.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> He's come a long way.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE starts walking away and JAIME follows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I am. It's, uh-it's good ground.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> It is.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> The rise, it should give us some advantage.</p>
      
      
      <p>They stop walking.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Yes, I think you're right.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE quickly turns to face JAIME.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> What are you doing?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> What?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I think you know.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I truly don't.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You want me to insult you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> No!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Good.</p>
      
      
      <p>He pauses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored
         to serve under your command, if you'll have me.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE goes silent and looks down briefly. She returns his gaze.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I better get back.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE walks off, leaving JAIME standing alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - DAENERYS’ QUARTERS</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS’ door opens and JORAH walks in.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> Forgive me, khaleesi.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Have you done something to offend me?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> Many things.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Long ago and long forgiven.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand,
         it broke my heart.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> You made the right choice.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all
         I could do not to throw him in the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>JORAH chuckles.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> But the mind behind all those words-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS walks into the library.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Royce">ROYCE</span> The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the
         gates.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans to show ROYCE and SANSA sitting at a table together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the
         countryside.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both notice DAENERYS’ presence and stand up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>ROYCE looks at SANSA who nods, granting him leave. ROYCE walks towards DAENERYS, bows
         and then exits. DAENERYS turns to watch him leave before turning back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.</p>
      
      
      <p>She starts walking towards SANSA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when
         he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You never should have either.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I thought he knew his sister.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Families are complicated.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Ours certainly have been.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both sit down in the seats SANSA and ROYCE were previously occupying.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> A sad thing to have in common.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who
         aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it,
         from what I can tell.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA returns her uneasy smile.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your
         brother.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> He loves you, you know that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> That bothers you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS: All my life, I've known one goal</span> the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost
         destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I'm here, half a world
         away, fighting Jon's war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom?</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA scoffs; she then leans forward and places her hand on DAENERYS’ hand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS places her other hand on top of SANSA’s.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his
         word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> Who was the first?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Someone taller.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both chuckle with one another.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens
         then?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> I take the Iron Throne.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd
         never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS removes her hand and looks away from SANSA. MAESTER WOLKAN enters the library.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOLKAN</span> Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS turns in her seat, agitated.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> What is it?</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>WOLKAN leads DAENERYS and SANSA into the great hall, where we see THEON GREYJOY standing
         in the centre of the hall surrounded by many of the Ironborn. DAENERYS looks shocked,
         THEON walks up to her and bends his knee.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> My queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your sister?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the
         Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> But why aren't you with her?</p>
      
      
      <p>THEON looks at SANSA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANSA walks up to THEON quickly and hugs him tightly. THEON hugs back.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>Many Northerners wait in line to be served food. DAVOS is filling the bowls.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Milord, we're not soldiers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a
         fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls.
         If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons
         at the forge. Right that way.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Thank you.</p>
      
      
      <p>He nods towards DAVOS and walks off with his bowl.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Craster">GILLY</span> When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans to show GILLY leading a young woman and an older couple, showing them
         where they will stay during the battle.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Craster">GILLY</span> They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> Thank you.</p>
      
      
      <p>TEELA, a young girl, walks up to where the food is being served and holds her bowl
         up. DAVOS has his back turned.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TEELA</span> Which way should I go?</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS turns back around and looks at her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Which way do you want to go?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TEELA</span> All the children will be going below when the time comes.</p>
      
      
      <p>GILLY overhears the conversation and starts to walk over.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TEELA</span> But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS takes her bowl and fills it up as GILLY sits down next to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Craster">GILLY</span> That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot
         better with you down there to protect us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> I'm sure a lot of people would.</p>
      
      
      <p>He hands her bowl back to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">TEELA</span> All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.</p>
      
      
      <p>TEELA walks off and DAVOS smiles at GILLY. A horn is then blared and the gates are
         opened as the remaining members of the nights watch return with TORMUND GIANTSBANE
         and BERIC DONDARRION. SAMWELL TARLY greets DOLOROUS EDD who has just returned. JON
         sees them and quickly heads over. Before he can embrace EDD, TORMUND hugs him first.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> My little crow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I thought we'd lost you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Almost.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns to hug EDD. He then turn to BERIC and shakes his hand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> How did you find each other?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> We met up at the Last Hearth.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> The dead got there first.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> The Umbers?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> Fighting for the Night King now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> How long do we have?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Before the sun comes up tomorrow.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at SAMWELL with a concerned look. TORMUND looks back over his shoulder,
         surveying his surroundings.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> The big woman still here?</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT. WINTERFELL - DAY</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALLS</p>
      
      
      <p>Northern soldiers jog around the walls of Winterfell</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> They're coming.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>Men are removing dragonglass weapons from carriages and handing to soldier. The camera
         pans and GENDRY lifts a dragonglass axe up and hands it to a man.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>The Unsullied pull ropes, causing a large boulder to be thrown into the air by a large
         trebuchet. More soldiers march out of the gates of Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark"></span> But there are too many of them.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS</p>
      
      
      <p>Archers walk up to the edge of the battlements with their bow and arrows. We see a
         man stretch the bow string</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Far too many.</p>
      
      
      <p>A horse neighs and the man looks up over the wall.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>The Dothraki ride along the outside of the wall as the camera pans past the trench
         of spikes used to defend from the Army of the Dead.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Our enemy doesn't tire.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera moves farther down until it reaches a gap in the trench outside the gate,
         the Dothraki ride through the center as Unsullied soldiers emerge from the gate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY</p>
      
      
      <p>In the library, a large table has a map of Winterfell laid out over it, with various
         markers placed outside the castle. The Unsullied are organized in three groups in
         the middle outside the front of the. To either side of the Unsullied are markers representing
         the Northerners and in front are the Dothraki. Facing towards all these troops are
         markers representing the Army of the Dead, these markers far outnumber the allies
         of Winterfell. Standing around the table (clockwise) is SANSA, JON, ARYA, SAMWELL,
         THEON, ALYS, BRIENNE, JAIME, BERIC, TORMUND, DAVOS, LYANNA, ROYCE, QHONO, GREY WORM,
         VARYS, DAENERYS, JORAH and TYRION. BRAN is seated behind JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We can't beat them in a straight fight.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> So, what can we do?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him
         may be our best chance.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> If that's true, he'll never expose himself.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> Yes, he will.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone in the room turns to look at Bran.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Why? What does he want?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've
         been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't
         come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world
         of men, I'd start with you.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> How will he find you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> His mark is on me.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRAN lifts the cuff of his right arm, revealing a red mark in the shape of a hand.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> He always knows where I am.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait
         for him in the Godswood.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans over the map of Winterfell, to the East but still within the walls,
         is the Godswood.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">SANSA</span> You want us to use you as bait?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> We're not leaving you alone out there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">THEON</span> He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you.
         Let me defend you now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal
         to light the trench.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION looks shocked and turns to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women
         risking their lives.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they
         can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind.
         If we survive, I'll need it.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION nods.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> The dragons should give us an edge in the field.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not
         too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Dragonfire will stop him?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> I don't know. No one's ever tried.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> We're all going to die.</p>
      
      
      <p>He turns to look at BRIENNE.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> But at least we die together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Let's get some rest.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone begins to leave the library as JON and DAENERYS remain at the table.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON then exits along with almost everyone else. Only TYRION and BRAN remain.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Do you need help?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> No.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You've had a strange journey.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> Stranger than most.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'd like to hear about it.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION grabs a wooden chair and drags it over next to BRAN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">BRAN</span> It's a long story.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION sits in the chair.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>Unsullied soldiers clean their weapons as GREY WORM walks past. MISSANDEI walks into
         the courtyard and sees two young girls.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">MISSANDEI</span> Hello.</p>
      
      
      <p>The girls quickly grab one another’s hands and run off. GREY WORM stands behind her
         as she turns around to face him. GREY WORM walks up to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GREY WORM</span> When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to
         my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is
         over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else
         you want to do, nothing else you want to see?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">MISSANDEI</span> Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GREY WORM</span> Then I will take you there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">MISSANDEI</span> My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GREY WORM</span> My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT. WINTERFELL - NIGHT</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera pans up over the wall and SAMWELL and JON stand next to each other with
         GHOST, JON’s direwolf, behind them. SAMWELL leans over slightly towards JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Have you told her yet?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> No.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-</p>
      
      
      <p>He pauses and they both look at each other and fall silent. EDD walks up the stair
         behind them and stands between them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> And now our watch begins.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Gilly? Little Sam?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> They'll be safe down in the crypt.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> If you want to join them.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL looks at him and frowns.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> To protect them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed
         Thenns.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> Thenn.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the
         Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Well, calling you "fucked" wouldn't be strictly accurate.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL chuckles and EDD looks at him. He turns to see JON laughing too.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more
         signs the world was ending.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Now it's just us three.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tollett">EDD</span> Last man left, burn the rest of us.</p>
      
      
      <p>The camera rises over the wall and the silhouette of the trees in the distance block
         the light slowly fading over the horizon.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>The fire in the hearth of the hall is lit. Two wooden chairs sit facing it, occupied
         by JAIME to the left of the fire and TYRION to the right. They both sip on wine.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I wish Father were here.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME looks at TYRION in shock.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about
         to die defending Winterfell.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME snorts.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> That would be something to see.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Mm.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the
         world who was sleeping with his sister.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I was speaking in relative terms.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Do you miss it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Of course I miss it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION sighs</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It's not. Things would be easier if it were.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION raises his cup to toast.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> The perils of self-betterment.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME raises his and they both go to drink. JAIME stops himself when the door to the
         hall opens and BRIENNE and PODRICK walk in. JAIME stands up quickly and they both
         turn to look at the visitors.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Oh! My lady.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some
         of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION walks over to where the wine is kept, PODRICK starts to walk to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> Thank you, milord.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I don't think that's wise.</p>
      
      
      <p>PODRICK turns back to BRIENNE.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> The battle might start at any moment.</p>
      
      
      <p>She pauses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Half cup.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And you?</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION continues to pour PODRICK’s drink until the cup overflows with wine.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME places another chair in front of the fire.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> All right. Just a bit.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION pours BRIENNE a drink and hands it to her as she sits down. PODRICK grabs a
         chair and brings it over and sits down. DAVOS and TORMUND enter the hall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Well, what do we have here?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ser Davos, join us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS stands in front of the fire to warm up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice
         and warm in here.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND walks up to BRIENNE and stands in front of her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> It could be our last night in this world, you know.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME, now sitting down next to BRIENNE, glances up.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.</p>
      
      
      <p>She pauses and quickly tries to recover.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Would you like a drink?</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND turns to TYRION and raises his drinking horn.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Brought my own.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND looks at JAIME, over to BRIENNE, and then back to JAIME again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> They call you "King Killer."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'm sure someone does.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> They call me "Giantsbane." Want to know why?</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME sighs and looks over at TYRION who is still standing to the side of the room
         with his wine. TORMUND grabs a wooden chair and places it with his back to the fire
         so that he is facing JAIME and BRIENNE. He sits down and leans forwards.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS glances at TORMUND, clearly perplexed.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months.
         Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.</p>
      
      
      <p>TORMUND raises the horn to his mouth and starts drinking from it whilst gulping noisily.
         Everyone stares at him as the drink pours out the horn, mostly down his front.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> Maybe I will have that drink.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS</p>
      
      
      <p>SANDOR “THE HOUND” CLEGANE sits with back against the battlements drinking alone.
         ARYA walks up to him and he notices her. She walks closer and SANDOR silently offers
         the drink. ARYA sits down next to SANDOR and takes a swig. They sit silently staring
         ahead.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Guess I've changed.</p>
      
      
      <p>She pauses.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> What are you doing up here?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> What's it look like?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond
         the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone
         but yourself?</p>
      
      
      <p>SANDOR turns to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> I fought for you, didn't I?</p>
      
      
      <p>BERIC walks up to the two of them and stops in front of them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.</p>
      
      
      <p>BERIC smiles. He turns to look at ARYA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.</p>
      
      
      <p>SANDOR turns to ARYA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> Was he on your list?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> For a little while.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> That's all right.</p>
      
      
      <p>BERIC sits down on a barrel opposite the two.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Dondarrion">BERIC</span> The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When
         light-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if
         you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just
         to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.</p>
      
      
      <p>He points to the wall he’s leaning against. BERIC chuckles and holds his hand out.
         SANDOR passes him the drink. ARYA stands up and starts walking away from them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">SANDOR</span> Where are you going?</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA turns around to look at them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA exits and SANDOR and BERIC sit in silence.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - HALLWAY</p>
      
      
      <p>A bowstring creaks as an arrow is fired. It hits its target next to two other arrows
         previously shot. The camera cuts to see ARYA holding a large bow in a dimly lit hallway.
         She lowers it and picks up another arrow. GENDRY watches from a doorway. She fires
         the arrow and turns as GENDRY walks up to her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> That for me?</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY raises a spear with a dragonglass head. ARYA lays down her bow and takes the
         spear.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> This'll work.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> What did the Red Woman want with you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Why your blood?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.</p>
      
      
      <p>Arya stops fiddling with her new weapon at this revelation and stares at Gendry.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches
         all over me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Was that your first time?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Your first time with a woman.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY scoffs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Or after?</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY stammers indistinctly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> You don't remember?</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY scoffs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Yes, I was.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> One? Two? Twenty?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Well, I didn't keep count.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> Yes, you did.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENDRY sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Three.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA pauses and walks up to him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Baratheon">GENDRY</span> Arya, I-</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA inhales sharply as she pulls GENDRY in and starts kissing him. They start undressing
         themselves and each other whilst still kissing. She pushes GENDRY back onto a pile
         of bags as she takes off her top. GENDRY, who is still just wearing his pants, notices
         a couple scars on ARYA’s side.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.</p>
      
      
      <p>She pulls her own pants off and climbs on top of GENDRY and starts kissing him.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>The fire is still lit and the people who were in there earlier still sit there. Opposite
         the fire sits (from left to right) TORMUND, BRIENNE, JAIME, DAVOS, TYRION and PODRICK.
         They sit in silence before TYRION breaks it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another.
         And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> At least we'll die with honor.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I think we might live.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS and PODRICK both start laughing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor
         of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> All without a shred of combat ability.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME stands up to get himself another drink.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> She's not a ser? You're not a knight?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Women can't be knights.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Why not?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> Tradition.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Fuck tradition.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarth">BRIENNE</span> I don't even want to be a knight.</p>
      
      
      <p>PODRICK looks at her, slightly confused. BRIENNE ignores him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME places his cup on the table where the wine is kept.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'll prove it.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME unsheathes his sword and stands in the middle of the room and holds his sword
         out.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Kneel, Lady Brienne.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE scoffs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE looks at PODRICK who nods. She stands up, walks to the middle of the room
         opposite JAIME and kneels before him. PODRICK and DAVOS both turn in their seats to
         see and TYRION and TORMUND both stand. JAIME places the sword on her right shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.</p>
      
      
      <p>He raises it over her head and places it on her left shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.</p>
      
      
      <p>He raises the sword and places it on her right shoulder again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.</p>
      
      
      <p>He lowers the sword to his side.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE smiles as she stands up and the rest of the room all applaud.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE smiles ecstatically, tears of joy in her eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL is walking down the stairs from the battlements</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> We have all we need to win this war.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again.</p>

      <p>SAMWELL notices the two talking down in the courtyard and starts to walk towards them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> I don't need you to remind me of that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>We now see JORAH and LYANNA up close.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.</p>
      
      
      <p>LYANNA turns around to see SAMWELL facing them both.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANN</span> It's all right. We're done here.</p>
      
      
      <p>LYANNA starts to walk off but stops and turns back to JORAH.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">LYANNA</span> I wish you good fortune, cousin.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> Thank you, my lady.</p>
      
      
      <p>LYANNA exits and SAMWELL walks closer to JORAH.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> What have you got there?</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL raises his sword.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> You still have a family.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your
         father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's
         Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.</p>
      
      
      <p>He hands JORAH the sword and JORAH removes it from its sheath slightly to examine
         it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Mormont">JORAH</span> I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> I'll see you when it's through.</p>
      
      
      <p>SAMWELL walks off but stops several feet away and turns back to JORAH.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Tarly">SAMWELL</span> I hope we win.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone sits around the fire still but DAVOS is standing next to where the wine is.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> We'd better get some rest.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> No, let's stay a bit longer.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> We're out of wine.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ser Brienne?</p>
      
      
      <p>BRIENNE shakes her head. TYRION turns to TORMUND who shakes his head too.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Giantsbane">TORMUND</span> Mm-mm.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Mmm.</p>
      
      
      <p>PODRICK starts singing “Jenny of Oldstones”.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the

      <p>The camera pans and we see GENDRY sleeping on the pile of bags and ARYA lays next
         to him with her eyes open. PODRICK’s singing continues.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD</p>
      
      
      <p>The Unsullied start walking out of the courtyard as MISSANDEI and GREY WORM walk together
         before he stops her, turns to her, and kisses her. He then turns to leave with the
         Unsullied and MISSANDEI watches as he leaves. PODRICK’s singing continues.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone gathers outside the castle as they prepare for battle. JORAH rides on his
         horse and gazes at the horizon to see only darkness. PODRICK’s singing continues.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Payne">PODRICK</span> Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT. WINTERFELL - NIGHT</p>
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS turns a corner as she sees JON staring at a statue of his biological mother,
         LYANNA STARK. She walks up to him. He glances at her and smiles as she walks closer.
         She holds his arm as they both look at the statue together.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Who's that?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Lyanna Stark.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS looks troubled.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave
         money to poor children. And he raped her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> He didn't. He loved her.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns to face DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert
         would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last
         thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother,
         Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS starts to look at him, slightly concerned.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS exhales sharply as she pulls away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> That's impossible.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I wish it were.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Who told you this?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Bran. He saw it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> He saw it?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even
         knowing what it meant.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't
         seem strange to you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> It's true, Dany. I know it is.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have
         a claim to the Iron Throne.</p>
      
      
      <p>Suddenly a horn blares and JON turns around.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS</p>
      
      
      <p>JON and DAENERYS walk behind the battlements and stand next to TYRION as the three
         stare out over the wall.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Form up! Get yourselves back!</p>
      
      
      <p>JON nods at DAENERYS and they both quickly exit. TYRION watches but turns his attention
         back over the wall. The camera pans away.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: PATH TO WINTERFELL</p>
      
      
      <p>In an icy haze, the mangled legs of a dead horse trot forward before stopping. The
         camera pans up to show a white walker sitting upon the dead horse and the entire army
         of white walkers standing in a line upon their horses is slowly revealed. The camera
         pans around their backs before settling on the faint glow of Winterfell in the distance.</p>
