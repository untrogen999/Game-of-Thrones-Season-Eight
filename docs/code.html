        <p> We started our project by marking up all of the tv episodes, which were accessed through
                <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Game-of-thrones/Season-8-scripts">Genius Game of
                Thrones Season 8 Scripts </a> . We tagged characters, stage directions, characters
            house alliances, and a couple of other things which is avalible to you if you look under
            the <a href="Ep.html">Episode Scripts</a> tab or you can access it through <a
                href="https://github.com/tlr39/GOT">GitHub</a>. Our original goal was to find a way
            to show character patterns in season 8 that weren't representative of the series as a
            whole but we couldn't come up with a way that would demostrate that with our intro level
            coding skill and the amount of time we had to work. Both Dr. Campbell and Amber think
            that this is a project that other digital humanities students could use and expand on in
            future classes, I think that would be really cool to see. What we were able to
            accomplish with our project was using our skills that we learned in digital humanities
            to markup the scripts, find patterns in the characters speeches using regex, and lastly
            using svg to create and output a chart to compare speeches between two main characters.
            We included the <a href="houses.html"> House </a> tab which was created by using lists
            of the main characters from each house in season 8. Also, we included a <a
                href="Map.html"> Map </a> tab where people can view the Map of Westeros to follow
            the chacracters journey to the Capital. Both the image of the cast on the homepage and
            the image of the house banners on the house page were retrieved from Pinterest and the
            map image was retrieved from Polygon, so a thank you to those for providing us with our
            images. Overall, this project was alot of fun and something to be proud of for our first
            time ever coding and we couldn't have done it with out our student instructor Amber or
            our professor Dr. Campbell.</p>
