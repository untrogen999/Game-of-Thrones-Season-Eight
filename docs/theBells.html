      <h1>EPISODE 5 - THE BELLS</h1>
      
      <p>INT: DRAGONSTONE, VARYS'S CHAMBERS</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS sits at an ornate desk, writing a letter about JON SNOW's true heritage. Only
         partially visible, it includes the phrases, "... is not the only Targaryen left, Rhaegar
         and Lyanna ..." and " ... their son lives still, hidden by Eddard Stark ... " and
         " ... he is the true heir to the Iron Throne ...". There is an knock on the door.
         VARYS discretely hides what he has been writing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Come in.</p>
      
      
      <p>The door opens and MARTHA enters, sheepish.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> And?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> (shakes her head)</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Nothing?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> She won't eat.</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS taps the table rhythmically as he thinks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> We'll try again at supper.</p>
      
      
      <p>He returns to writing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> I think they're watching me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Who?</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> Her soldiers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Of course they are. That's their job.</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS extends his hand kindly. MARTHA comes closer and clasps hold.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> What have I told you, Martha?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MARTHA</span> The greater the risk, the greater the reward.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.</p>
      
      
      <p>MARTHA exits.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: DRAGONSTONE SHORE, BEACH OVERLOOK</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION LANNISTER stands above the beach, watching a boat being beached by its crew.
         JON walks from the boat to VARYS.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE BEACH</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> The Northern armies?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.
         How is she?</p>
      
      
      <p>JON and VARYS walk inland.</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted
         any food.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> She shouldn't be alone.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Aren't you worried for her?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss
         a coin and the world holds its breath.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> We're not much for riddles where I'm from.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> We both know what she's about to do.</p>
      
      
      <p>They pause. JON sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> That's her decision to make. She is our queen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> What do you want?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how
         her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON considers.</p>
      
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I don't want it. I never have.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what
         they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs,

         kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen
         what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But
         what I tell you now is true You will rule wisely and well, while she--</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> She is my queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON continues on, alone. VARYS sighs.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: BEACH OVERLOOK</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION continues to watch JON and VARYS from above, his brow furrowed from concern
         and contemplation..</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION enters, stopping at the threshold.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Your Grace?</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS TARGARYEN does not reply. TYRION walks cautiously to DAENERYS, who stands,
         looking out at the shoreline.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> There's something you need to know.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Someone has betrayed me.</p>
      
      
      <p>Surprised, TYRION does not answer right away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Yes.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Jon Snow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Varys.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> He knows the truth about Jon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> He does.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I
         begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're
         facing.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> And Varys?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It was a mistake.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She trusts me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own
         queen. And you did not let her down.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what
         you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS does not reply.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> But it doesn't matter now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> No. It doesn't matter now.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION takes measure of DAENERYS. She returns to her view of the landscape. She looks
         haggard and ill, more pale than ever with heavy bags under her eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: VARYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>VARYS sits writing by candlelight. In the distance, a door opens. VARYS looks up and
         folds the scroll he was writing. He uses the candle to set it aflame, then snuffs
         the burning parchment. The sound of footsteps draw closer. VARYS removes his rings
         and places them in a small bowl. He sits, quietly resigned to his fate. The plodding
         of the approaching guards echo in the chamber. The door opens and GREY WORM enters,
         accompanied by a handful of Unsullied. He pauses and gives VARYS a menacing look.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM and the Unsullied guards lead VARYS through the caverns by torchlight. They
         exit onto the rocky shore, passing an unhappy TYRION. DAENERYS stands in front of
         the surf with JON at her side. VARYS faces them, having accepted his fate. TYRION
         approaches from the side, and they exchange a knowing look.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> It was me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VARYS</span> (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION and VARYS take in their good-bye. TYRION touches VARYS's shackled hands kindly,
         and steps away. VARYS fights to maintain his composure. DAENERYS steps forward.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and
         Mother of Dragons ...</p>
      
      
      <p>From behind her, DROGON's head emerges from the darkness, growling.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.</p>
      
      
      <p>DROGON rears up behind DAENERYS and roars. Fright takes over VARYS's face. DROGON
         steadies himself, roars between his teeth, and quickly unleashes an inferno that consumes
         VARYS. TYRION watches, deeply sorrowful. JON stands quietly, willing himself to follow
         his queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS sits by the fire, holding MISSANDEI's leather collar. GREY WORM stands at
         attention.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS hands the collar to GREY WORM. He looks it over, masking his pain, and throws
         it in the fireplace, where it shrivels and burns. At the sound of footsteps, GREY
         WORM regains his composure and turns to face JON as he enters. DAENERYS hides her
         sorrow as well.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM nods and exits. JON approaches DAENERYS. There is an awkward silence.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> What did I say would happen if you told your sister?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I don't want it, and that's what I told him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for
         her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people
         in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> I love you. And you will always be my queen.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS stands and walks to JON.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Is that all I am to you? Your queen?</p>
      
      
      <p>They kiss. It is tentative at first, and then passion consumes them, until JON pulls
         away. He looks at her, deeply conflicted. DAENERYS shakes her head ever so slightly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> All right, then.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS takes a step back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Let it be fear.</p>
      
      
      <p>INT: DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS sits on the throne. TYRION and GREY WORM stand on the main floor, looking
         up at her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the
         ones you liberated in Meereen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the
         moment I arrived.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't
         expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city
         burns.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she
         thinks our mercy is - weakness.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I beg you, my queen-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who
         will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION is silent and disappointed in her decision.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join
         the Northern armies.</p>
      
      
      <p>Desperate, TYRION ascends the platform stairs to get closer to DAENERYS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that
         chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please,
         if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS considers TYRION's suggestion. She nods quietly to GREY WORM, accepting the
         plan.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM nods and then exits. TYRION and DAENERYS look at one another silently. Then
         TYRION slowly bows every so slightly, expressing his gratitude to his Queen. He turns
         and starts to walk away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION stops and turns.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</span> It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will
         be the last time you fail me.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION pivots and exits.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>The citizens of King's Landing chatter as they move into the protective walls of the
         Red Keep. They hold onto their loved ones and carry supplies on their backs or balanced
         on their heads. The guards help to keep them moving through the main entrance to the
         Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GUARD 1</span> Let them pass.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GUARD 2</span> Through the gate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">GUARD 3</span> Get going.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: THE SEAS OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>JON and TYRION ride in a boat towards land. TYRION broods while JON is resigned. DAVOS
         waits for them on the shore below King's Landing, where their forces have made camp.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY</p>
      
      
      <p>The camp is busy as the forces prepare for the upcoming battle. DAVOS, TYRION, and
         JON pause a few yards from the shore.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> The rearguard should be here by daybreak.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She wants to attack now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Daybreak at the earliest.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON turns to talk with some Stark soldiers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Careful with that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> My lord.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAVOS turns to leave as well, but TYRION stays him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</span> I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> He's always better when he's got some food in him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.</p>
      
      
      <p>The encampment has gone quiet for the night. Braziers light the camp at regular intervals.
         THE HOUND and ARYA STARK ride into camp. A SOLDIER stops them.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Ay up. Where you going?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">ARYA</span> I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.</p>
      
      
      <p>SOLDIER 3 is confused.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might
         not even die tomorrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> I need to go talk to my captain.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Go ahead, talk to him.</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA and THE HOUND continue on their way.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Where's he going?</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION walks past the Unsullied warriors who line the path. An UNSULLIED gives him
         a questioning look.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.</p>
      
      
      <p>The UNSULLIED is unresponsive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.</p>
      
      
      <p>Again, the UNSULLIED gives no response. TYRION clears his throat and tries again.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">UNSULLIED</span> We speak the common tongue.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a
         long day.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">UNSULLIED</span> We have orders to guard the prisoner.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Ordered by whom? The queen herself?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">UNSULLIED</span> No.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably
         by quite a lot.</p>
      
      
      <p>The UNSULLIED looks to his comrades. They file away. TYRION enters the tent.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME LANNISTER sits, eyes closed, chained by his neck and hands. TYRION enters behind
         him,.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> How did they find you?</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME holds up his golden right hand as explanation.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Did you consider taking it off?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> And you're going back to her, to die with her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You've underestimated her before.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Difficult to do from here.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION holds up the key to JAIME's chains. JAIME exhales heavily, impressed at this
         turn of events.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people
         in that city, innocent or otherwise.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason
         now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever
         done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> The city will fall tomorrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will
         fall tomorrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Why?</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION moves closer to JAIME, and crouches to meet him, eye to eye.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon
         skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down,
         down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A
         dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll
         make it to Pentos. Start a new life.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than
         Cersei winning this war-</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see
         Cersei again.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME considers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Swear to me.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You have my word.</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION unlocks JAIME's bonds.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the
         gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> I'll try.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the
         gates.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Your queen will execute you for this.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe
         she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME gives an apprehensive look. TYRION stands quickly.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems
         like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> You would have.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME starts to protest, but he is interrupted by TYRION's embrace. They hold one
         another tightly, aware this could be the last time they ever see each other. TYRION
         cries with an upwell of emotion. With a final look, TYRION exits quickly.</p>
      
      
      <p>EXT: KING'S LANDING, MORNING</p>
      
      
      <p>It is a quiet and beautiful morning. The Ironborn Fleet sits in the harbor, sails
         furled. The scorpions are fully manned in preparation for the coming onslaught. EUROON
         strides to the foredeck of his ship as the soldiers behind him load the scorpion.
         His eyes scan the far distance, looking for a sign of enemy forces.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Eyes on the horizon!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Load the scorpion!</p>
      
      
      <p>On another ship, Lannister soldiers load a massive bolt onto their scorpion.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: OUTER WALL OF KING'S LANDING</p>
      
      
      <p>Lannister archers hustle into position. Below them, city dwellers run towards the
         Red Keep for protection. Scorpions line the walls of King's Landing, loaded and ready.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Archers, close up!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 4</span> Up to the espringal!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 5</span> To the back of it!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 6</span> Archers, line up!</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE STREET BELOW</p>
      
      
      <p>A stream of citizens rushes anxiously towards the Red Keep. Lannister soldiers march
         double time in the opposite direction.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> This way! Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Clear the streets now!</p>
      
      
      <p>Above the crowded street, citizen shutter their windows. Below people take shelter
         in their homes, one MAN grabbing his wife and picking up his child.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> No!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> In, now. And you, come on.</p>
      
      
      <p>More citizens rush through the streets as others shutter their windows.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Inside, now!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Quickly.</p>
      
      
      <p>SOLDIER 2 directs the rushing citizens.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p>In a doorway, a woman soothes her infant as the crowd hurries past and her daughters
         carry their belongings inside.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">FATHER</span> My son!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Get inside!</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: ANOTHER STREET</p>
      
      
      <p>ARYA and THE HOUND walk calmly towards the Red Keep while anxious citizens stream
         around them. THE HOUND wears a hooded cloak to disguise his face.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Just ahead of you, I can see it!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> All right, move it!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Keep moving!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Keep going!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Keep moving!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Quickly!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> All the way!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">FATHER</span> Hold your mother's hand!</p>
      
      
      <p>Lannister soldiers move double time away from the Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: A DIFFERENT STREET</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME, cloaked and inconspicuous, removes the glove from his golden hand. He looks
         around.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 4</span> Make way for the Golden Company!</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME slides through the gate, down the center of a Golden Company battalion as they
         march in time.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 4</span> Close the gate!</p>
      
      
      <p>The gates close with a great clanging. JAIME continues to walk quietly towards the
         Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING</p>
      
      
      <p>The Golden Company stands at attention. Some of their faces betray their trepidation
         towards the forthcoming battle. HARRY STRICKLAND guides his mount in front of them.
         His eyes are fixed on the distance, where the Stark forces stretch across the panorama.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY</p>
      
      
      <p>The battered and snarling Northmen are crowded together. Behind them, the Dothraki
         and the Unsullied stand ready. On a rise just behind them stands JON, DAVOS, and GREY
         WORM. TYRION joins them as men file past. GREY WORM walks down the rise. They look
         at the battlements and forces in the near distance.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">TYRION</span> If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.</p>
      
      
      <p>JON looks at TYRION with apprehension. He exits, followed by DAVOS.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Move along now, lads.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI LANNISTER walks to the window and surveys the great capital city. In the far
         distance is the wall where her loyal forces are stationed, and the great plain beyond
         where the Stark and Targaryen forces await. Behind her, QYBURN and SER GREGOR "THE
         MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE stand ready.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>Masses of city dwellers continue to move through courtyards, gates, and walls to the
         protection of the Red Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> That's it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Go on, move it.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Keep moving.</p>
      
      
      <p>The crowd chatters as they churn towards the gate. Among them, THE HOUND becomes frustrated
         at the slow pace. He grabs NORA by the shoulder and brushes past her. ARYA returns
         her shock with a stare as she follows THE HOUND through the gate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Move.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Stay with him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Hold on.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> Hold my hand.</p>
      
      
      <p>Seizing the opportunity, NORA instructs her daughter, VICKY, to follow behind the
         THE HOUND and ARYA.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">NORA</span> Get behind there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Close the gate! No more through!</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND picks up the pace to make it through before the gate seals. ARYA follows.
         People rush through, but the gate closes in front of NORA and VICKY.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">NORA</span> No!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VICKY</span> No! Mommy!</p>
      
      
      <p>NORA, VICKY, and the others pound desperately on the massive doors.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">NORA</span> Vicky! Please!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">VICKY</span> No, please, sir!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Open the gate!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Close the gate!</p>
      
      
      <p>The massive crowd starts to panic, rushing towards to closed gate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 2</span> Open it!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 3</span> Open the gate!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Get back!</p>
      
      
      <p>NORA points VICKY to sneak through the crowd towards another way into the Keep.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">NORA</span> Look, try that one! Go! Go!</p>
      
      
      <p>The crowd surges, crushing soldiers and citizens against the closed gate. The clamor
         rises and people become even more desperate. Far behind, the hooded JAIME sees that
         the gates are closed. He tries to jostle his way forward.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Get back!</p>
      
      
      <p>Trapped by the crowd and still far from the gate, JAIME rips off his hood. He waves
         his golden hand at the soldiers, hoping that they will recognize him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">WOMAN</span> Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!</p>

      <p>JAIME's cries are useless, lost in the din and chaos of the crowd.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 1</span> Move away! Stop!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 5</span> Let us in!</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME gives up in frustration. He turns and fights through the crowd, moving away
         from this gate.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> We're not leaving!</p>
      
      
      <p>The crowd screams and shouts, growing larger by the minute. JAIME slips into any alleyway

      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>The shouts of the citizens have reached CERSEI's ears. She looks down soberly.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION surveys the two armies.</p>

      <p>The Lannister soldiers scan the horizon.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: BLACKWATER BAY</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON paces while his men look to the sky. Something in the sun catches his eye, and
         he shields his eyes as he looks directly at it. DROGON emerges from the blinding sun,
         diving through the sky towards the fleet. The Ironborn react to the attack.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER</span> Turn!</p>
      
      
      <p>They bring the scorpion around and fire a bolt at DROGON. DAENERYS and DROGON evade
         the bolt and continue their steep dive.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON has lost the dragon in the sun once again. DROGON soars above the fleet. With
         a roar, he levels his trajectory and lets forth an eruption of fire, decimating the
         boat in front of EURON, flying past with unbelievable speed. DROGON destroys another
         ship before arcing away for a second sortie.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Turn it around! Turn it around!</p>
      
      
      <p>Angry at the soldier's incompetence, EURON rushes to position the scorpion himself.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Get back! Back!</p>
      
      
      <p>He is too late. DROGON destroys another handful of ships as he strafes the fleet.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Fire!</p>
      
      
      <p>The scorpion fires at the banking DROGON, but misses. DAENERYS and DROGON come directly
         towards EURON's ship. The dragon belches forth fiery destruction, shattering EURON's
         ship as he leaps overboard to avoid incineration.</p>
      
      
      <p>DAENERYS and DROGON lay waste to the fleet and begin heading across the harbor towards
         the city itself, DROGON's tail skimming the water as they fly. Atop the walls, the
         soldiers aim their scorpions at the charging dragon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> I can see her! Ready!</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Fire!</p>
      
      
      <p>They fire a bolt, but DROGON gracefully dodges, continuing to close the distance to
         the city wall at tremendous speed.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Reload!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 3</span> Reload!</p>
      
      
      <p>The soldiers strain to ready the weapon for another strike.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Faster! Hurry!</p>
      
      
      <p>The bolt locks in place. They start to aim the scorpion, but they are too late. DROGON
         engulfs them in a great burst of flame. The soldiers and the scorpion disintegrate
         in the powerful eruption.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">SOLDIER 2</span> Fire!</p>
      
      
      <p>DROGON spews forth more destruction. Soldiers scream in agony. DAENERYS and DROGON
         swoop past as man and machine incinerate.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING</p>
      
      
      <p>It is quiet. The two forces are still in their stand off. HARRY STRICKLAND is mounted
         before the Golden Company. GREY WORM, JON, and DAVOS lead the Stark/Targaryen forces.
         GREY WORM takes a step forward, reacting to something no one else has sensed. A horse
         whinnies and the wind picks up, carrying the sound of great wings flapping. Everyone
         turns their heads to try and locate the rising sound. STRICKLAND seems to hone in
         on the location, but he is too late. The gated wall behind the Golden Company explodes
         in an enormous fireball, destroying a huge section of the wall and consuming dozens
         of soldiers as the fire spews forth in a rage. STRICKLAND is knocked from his horse
         by the blast as the Golden Company scatters and his mount expires. DROGON flies over
         the destruction.</p>
      
      
      <p>GREY WORM and the Unsullied charge, followed by the mounted Dothraki. Members of the
         Golden Company scream and writhe in agony as they burn. Stunned by the force of the
         blast, STRICKLAND pulls himself up on hands and knees. He sees the charging Dothraki
         army and panics. He finds his feet and begins flees towards the wall, limping and
         bloodied. The Dothraki ride past, as he looks nervously to either side. He falls,
         impaled by GREY WORM's spear. GREY WORM pauses to retrieve his spear from STRICKLAND's
         corpse with a grunt before resuming the charge with the rest of the Unsullied.</p>
      
      
      <p>Screamingly wildly, the Dothroaki gallop through the broken wall into King's Landing.
         Continuing full speed, they rip through the Lannister soldiers just inside the walls,
         speeding through the street. The Lannister soldiers fall like dominoes, no match for
         the ferocity of their charge. Behind the Dothraki, the Stark forces reach the wall,
         roaring as they enter the city. One Stark soldier kneels by a severely burned member
         of the Golden Company who lies supine on the ground. The Stark soldier plunges his
         sword through the man's heart.</p>
      
      
      <p>Above, DROGON flies along the wall and destroys another part of the battlement. The
         few Lannister soldiers who survived the Dothraki rise to meet the Stark men in battle,
         but they are no match. DROGON continues to destroy the unwieldy scorpions before they
         can even threaten the dragon. The Stark men continue to dispatch the Lannister soldiers,
         whose corpses begin speckle the streets. Scores of Lannister soldiers flee through
         an open yard, but DROGON catches up and destroys them with a mighty exhalation of
         fire. They die in a painful and brutal conflagration.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI listens to the sounds of destruction - the rumbling explosions and the screeching
         roar of the distant dragon. A vast section of the outer wall burns as DROGON and DAENERYS
         fly toward another part of the city. DROGON unleashes his fire breath once again.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE BREACHED WALL</p>
      
      
      <p>TYRION walks through the battlefield, stunned by the carnage. In the distance, more
         Northern soldiers rush towards the battle.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN 1</span> Go!</p>

      <p>DROGON strafes another row of scorpions, demolishing the ramparts where they are mounted.</p>

      <p>GREY WORM leads JON, DAVOS, and a force of Northern soldiers and Unsullied warriors
         through the charred and burning wasteland. Bodies are strewn everywhere. A Lannister
         soldier tries to set upon GREY WORM, but the Unsullied captain gores him clean through
         with his spear. Other Lannister soldiers make futile attacks that are quickly dispatched
         by JON and his men. Before them, the streets are empty and clear.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, A BIT LATER</p>
      
      
      <p>JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM reach a crowd of Stark soldiers who are at a stand off with

      <p>The Stark men part to let JON and his companions through . JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM
         stand in front of the Stark men facing the Lannister soldiers. The two sides take
         measure of one another, separated by the width of the street.</p>

      <p>TYRION passes through a burning wall, making his way among piles of charred bodies.
         Ahead of him, some Unsullied warriors clear the streets. Beyond them is a bell tower
         and, further back, is the Red Keep. Smoke fills the air.</p>

      <p>Citizens look up to see DROGON and DAENERYS diving towards them. DROGON roars and
         the panic ensues as people begin to run, desperate and terrified. Some protect their
         children while others knock down anyone in their way.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Run. Run! Come on!</p>
      
      
      <p>DROGON roars and glides over a street filled with fleeing innocents. He lands atop

      <p>The leader of the Lannister soldiers hears the powerful roar. He seems to lose faith
         as he looks at the men around him. He drops in sword in surrender. The rest of the

      <p>As DROGON flies overhead, the citizens and Lannister soldiers panic and run. Behind
         some fleeing guards, DROGON unleashes his fire, decimating the surrounding buildings
         and consuming the soldiers.</p>
      
      
      <p>Just beyond, innocents flee as quickly as they can. DROGON rises behind them, constantly
         spewing his deadly torrent of flame. Buildings collapse under the inferno, and citizens
         disappear as the raging fire consumes them.</p>

      <p>JON watches DROGON from afar. The Lannister soldiers turn at the sounds of destruction.
         GREY WORM breathes deeply, cold vengeance in his eyes. At the back of the Lannister
         battalion, an eruption of DROGON's flame destroys a building and sends soldiers scattering.
         GREY WORM begins to lower his spear for attack. The leader of the Lannister soldiers
         spins quickly to face JON, knowing the terms of surrender have been breached. Before
         he can speak, GREY WORM changes his grip on his spear and hurls it through the man's
         chest. He falls, dead. JON's attention snaps to the ground in front of him. He hesitates.
         The Stark men act first, screaming a battle cry as they launch themselves at the Lannister
         soldiers. JON is frozen in indecision as his men begin to decimate the Lannister soldiers.
         Time slows down. Suddenly, JON comes to his senses. He grabs the man closest to him
         and pulls him back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> No! Get back! Get back!</p>
      
      
      <p>The Northerners pour around him and JON manages to stop a handful. GREY WORM turns
         his head toward JON, staring with a look of fierce disapproval.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Stark">JON</span> Stay! Stay!</p>
      
      
      <p>JON's efforts are fruitless. GREY WORM stares coldly at him. Then a Lannister soldier
         attacks JON and he is forced into battle. GREY WORM turns to join the fray. JON defends
         and attacks. Further ahead, GREY WORM methodically dispatches guard after guard with
         precision and artistry. The Lannister soldiers are overwhelmed by the invading force.
         GREY WORM attacks with a brutality and rage, letting forth an uncharacteristic scream.
         His eyes are filled with hatred.</p>

      <p>Guards attack JON, forcing him back into the melee. The Stark men are starting to
         attack the fleeing citizens as well as Lannister soldiers. The frenzy of the battle
         takes over as the siege becomes a sacking of the city. The Unsullied attack expertly
         and without mercy.</p>
      
      
      <p>A little girl hides behind a pillar as others run. A Stark soldier tackles a citizen,

      <p><span class="speaker">LANNISTER SOLDIER</span> Go! Go!</p>
      
      
      <p>JON's men continue to sack the city. He meet the attacks on him by reflex. He is overwhelmed
         by the wild carnage and is inability to stop it. He snaps to as one a Stark soldier
         drags a woman into an alley to rape her. The woman falls to the ground and tries to
         crawl away. The soldier continues his assault. Suddenly, JON grabs him from behind
         and pulls him off the woman, holding the soldier against the wall with his left hand
         and brandishing his sword. The soldier is surprised and confused. They exchange a
         look. The soldier looks at his intended victim and becomes defiant. JON runs him through,
         and the soldier collapses to the ground.</p>

      <p>CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME has reached the mouth of the cave that leads into the Red Keep. A dinghy sits
         on the shore, just as TYRION promised. He starts into the cave, but is stopped by
         a voice behind him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> The Kingslayer.</p>
      
      
      <p>An exhausted EURON wades onto the beach. The Iron Fleet burns in the distance beyond
         him. He spits out seawater.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> Well, maybe for you.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME starts to leave, but EURON draws his sword behind him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.</p>

         you can kiss her one last time.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME swings his sword wildly at EURION, who evades back, stumbling against a boulder.
         JAIME brings down a powerful overhead swing that EURON dodges. Sword hits rock with
         a great clang.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>A piece of the ceiling falls, startling CERSEI. DROGON circles overhead. A great chunk
         of wall falls to the ground, crushing citizens below. DROGON and DAENERYS circle the
         keep, then bring their full force upon it. Spiraling about the Red Keep, DROGON slices
         through walls and towers with his devastating fire. The mighty castle starts to come
         undone and crash to the ground.</p>
      
      
      <p>CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP</p>
      
      
      <p>The broken tower slides down the cliffside and into the water just beyond the beach.
         JAIME runs further into the cave while EURON pursues him. JAIME swings his sword,
         but EURON jumps back and counters with his own attack, slicing JAIME across the chest.
         JAIME staggers against the rock. Pivoting, JAIME knocks away EURON's sword with a
         blow, and they begin to grapple. EURON elbows JAIME in the face, wraps him up, and
         jerks him off balance. JAIME loses his sword. EURON throws JAIME into the rock, and
         staggers to catch his breath. JAIME tackles him, but EURON managed to get astride
         JAIME delivers repeated blows to his face. JAIME coils his legs and kicks EURON in
         the throat. EURON falls to the ground, gagging for air. JAIME tries to land a great
         punch, but EURON avoids him, and grapples JAIME onto the wet sand. EURON chokes JAIME
         while JAIME tries to push him away. JAIME lands a two-handed blow to EURON's arms,
         head butts EURON, and tosses him aside. JAIME chokes up blood as EURON crawls towards
         his sword. JAIME grabs EURON's foot, and pulls him back. EURON kicks JAIME dives,
         and grabs his sword as JAIME grapples him. EURON pulls himself around and plunges
         his sword into JAIME's side. JAIME reels with pain. EURON grunts and pants, then he
         pulls his sword free from JAIME's torso. They both fall back. JAIME scuttles on his
         back, away from EURON, then rolls onto his back, gasping.</p>

      <p>CERSEI weeps. She takes QYBURN's hand, and he leads her away. Below them, plumes of
         green wildfire explosions join the wholesale devastation of the capitol city. Dark
         and putrid smoke fills the sky.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> You fought well for a cripple.</p>
      
      
      <p>JAIME wheezes, helpless. He looks down the beach. His sword is far from his grasp.
         He rolls onto his stomach and crawls towards it. EURON sees that there is still some
         fight in JAIME and he drop his head, sighing. JAIME reaches his sword, but EURON stands
         above him and plunges his sword into JAIME's side once again. Both grunt, then JAIME
         pushes EURON onto the ground, and rights himself. He gores EURON through the stomach.
         They both yell. JAIME pushes his sword in further, pinning EURON against sand and
         rock. He steps back. EURON grabs the blade with both hands. Both pant and scream.
         JAIME forces the sword in further. Hate joins the pain on EURON's face.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> Another king for you.</p>
      
      
      <p>EURON grunts and JAIME pulls out his sword and stands over EURON. Blood pours from
         his stomach as EURON's head bows in relief. JAIME starts his way into the cave. EURON
         slides down the rock towards the sand. He twists his head to watch JAIME leave.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Greyjoy">EURON</span> But I got you!</p>

         ARYA enter the crumbing courtyard. They look up to the skies. DROGON roars. THE HOUND
         gives his head a little shake, knowing they have reached the point of no return.</p>

      <p>With a knowing look, THE HOUND exits the map courtyard and moves further into the

      <p>CERSEI, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN, and the Queensguard descend the tower</p>
      
      <p>staircase as DROGON roars overhead. A great section of the ceiling collapses behind
         them, revealing the ferocious glow of the fireball overhead. The tower shakes and
         the party falls to their knees. THE MOUNTAIN is felled by a chunk from the ceiling.
         Above them, the tower ceiling comes apart. THE MOUNTAIN shields CERSEI and PYCELLE
         with his body, taking great blows from the chunks that rain down. CERSEI cowers. DROGON
         roars again and the entire ceiling gives way, burying some of the Queensguard.</p>
      
      
      <p>When then destruction settles, THE MOUNTAIN stands erect. CERSEI and QYBURN are unharmed.
         There is nothing left of the tower behind them, only open sky filled with smoke. Debris
         falls continuously as the tower above them crumbles. THE HOUND enters below them.
         He nods at CERSEI.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Your Grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>The four remaining Queensguard rush down to engage THE HOUND. He easily dispatches
         each of them in turn. He looks up to THE MOUNTAIN.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Hello, big brother.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> Ser Gregor, stay by my side.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE MOUNTAIN pauses and looks back at CERSEI with his gruesome red eyes. He takes
         another step.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">QYBURN</span> Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.</p>
      
      
      <p>QYBURN moves to intercept THE MOUNTAIN. The hulk effortlessly picks up QYBURN by the
         neck and tosses him down the steps. QYBURN's head smashes against the rubble-strewn
         stairs when he lands, cracking his skull and killing him instantaneously. THE MOUNTAIN
         takes a few more steps towards THE HOUND as CERSEI quivers behind him. DROGON roars.
         The Clegane brothers take measure of one another. CERSEI tentatively walks past THE
         MOUNTAIN and then slides past THE HOUND. She exits. More rubble falls as DROGON soars
         overhead, spewing fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE HOUND walks up the stairs towards THE MOUNTAIN, then draws his sword and starts
         his attack. THE MOUNTAIN fends off the blows with his armored arms, then grabs THE
         HOUND's blade. Enraged, THE HOUND rips his weapon free and attacks anew. THE MOUNTAIN
         parries with his arm. On his third blow, THE HOUND knocks off THE MOUNTAIN's helmet,
         revealing his brother's ghoulish face. The skin of THE MOUNTAIN'S revived corpse is
         fetid and rotting.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</span> Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.</p>
      
      
      <p>THE MOUNTAIN draws his sword. He unleashed powerful swings that crush the railing
         and wall when THE HOUND dodges. Their swords clash with a powerful clang. THE MOUNTAIN
         roars.</p>

      <p>The castle continues to fall around her as CERSEI makes her way through the Red Keep.
         DROGON roars overhead. An exhausted JAIME enters the courtyard. CERSEI turns and sees
         JAIME propping himself up against a pillar. Her face brightens as she stares at him
         with disbelief. She sobs and he walks to her. They embrace and hold tight, panting.
         JAIME looks at her tears.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">CERSEI</span> You're hurt.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker" house="Lannister">JAIME</span> It doesn't matter.</p>
      
      
      <p>CERSEI pulls her hands away. They are covered in JAIME's blood. JAIME caresses her

      <p>More of the Keep tumbles down. JAIME looks around for safe passage away from courtyard.
         They stagger together into the arcade.</p>

      <p>THE HOUND and THE MOUNTAIN battle ferociously. THE HOUND spins, traps THE MOUNTAIN's
         arms between his body and his left arm, then leverages THE MOUNTAIN's sword away.
         He steps back and plunges his sword into THE MOUNTAIN's stomach, grunting with effort.
         He looks up with gritted teeth and forces the blade in further. THE MOUNTAIN stands
         impassive, one hand cupping the blade. THE HOUND cannot believe that THE MOUNTAIN
         still stands. He roars and pushes the blade harder. THE MOUNTAIN unleashes a mighty
         backhand that sends THE HOUND tumbling backward down the steps. THE HOUND struggles
         to look up. He watches THE MOUNTAIN pull the blade from hit gut, his armor falling
         away. THE MOUNTAIN descends towards THE HOUND, who sighs in exasperation. The tower
         continues to collapse. THE HOUND chuckles at the impossibility of it all. THE MOUNTAIN
         grabs him by the collar, and flips him over, roughly.</p>

      <p>ARYA moves through the streets. Wounded denizens lean against the wall, screaming
         and wailing. Ash fills the air as debris falls and fires burn. ARYA switches directions
         and walks through the chaos. People yell and scream.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">OWEN</span> Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?</p>

      <p>OWEN lets go and rushes off. ARYA continues. A child wails as others cry out in pain.
         ARYA ducks away from falling stone as people rush past her.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> Out of the way!</p>
      
      
      <p>Flapping can be heard overhead. ARYA quickens her pace and collides with a man wearing
         a turban. DROGON roars. ARYA and the man push past one another. She heads down a darken
         staircase and emerges in a scene of carnage, the wounded huddled and hiding. Women
         wail, holding their mortally wounded loved ones. DROGON flaps his wings above them.
         ARYA flees. The man in front of her is felled by debris.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="speaker">MAN</span> No!</p>
      
      
      <p>DROGON roars and flies over them, his mouth spewing flames. ARYA jostles through the
         alley and into a flood of people running in panic. She gets pulled into the screaming
         mob. She looks behind her to scan the skies, but she loses her footing and falls under
         the rushing crowd.</p>

      <p>NORA helps ARYA to her feet. VICKY is by her side. DROGON roars overhead. Everyone
         ducks as DROGON flies past. The buildings around them start to collapse. People start
         to scatter. ARYA and NORA get torn from one another, swept up in the crowds.</p>

      <p>THE MOUNTAIN throws THE HOUND to the ground again. THE HOUND groans. THE MOUNTAIN
         picks his brother up by the neck and chokes him, slamming him against the wall. THE
         HOUND gurgles, exhausted and desperate for air. Gagging, THE HOUND tries to gain purchase
         on THE MOUNTAIN's hands. He shakes and writhes as THE MOUNTAIN pins him to the wall.
         THE HOUND frees his dagger from his belt and stabs THE MOUNTAIN just above the clavicle.
         THE MOUNTAIN does not react. THE HOUND stabs again with a grunt. Again, THE MOUNTAIN
         does not react. THE HOUND then stabs THE MOUNTAIN repeatedly in the torso.</p>

      <p>THE HOUND stabs THE MOUNTAIN below the neck once more. THE HOUND laughs and chokes
         at the impossibility of THE MOUNTAIN's stamina. THE MOUNTAIN moves his thumbs atop
         the HOUND's eyes, presses his hands like a vice around THE HOUND's head, and raises
         his brother high in the air. He presses his thumbs into THE HOUND's eye sockets. THE
         HOUND lets out short screams, his feet dangling helplessly. He blindly feels around
         THE MOUNTAIN's face before plunging his dagger deep into THE MOUNTAIN's left eye,
         the blade penetrating clean through to the other side. THE MOUNTAIN steps backward
         and THE HOUND collapses onto the floor. THE MOUNTAIN staggers backward, confused and
         blinded. THE HOUND coughs and sits upright. THE HOUND growls at his brother and pants.
         The MOUNTAIN regains his composure and slowly reaches for the hilt of the knife. The
         HOUND watches in disbelief. The MOUNTAIN starts to tug at the dagger. Screaming, THE
         HOUND launches himself at his brother. Just as THE MOUNTAIN frees the dagger from
         his face, THE HOUND tackles him. They crash through the compromised wall behind them.
         They fall amidst an avalanche of stone down to the raging fire far below and disappear
         into the conflagration.</p>

      <p>The Stark men yell at the Lannister soldiers while the citizens of King's Landing
         are caught in between. Behind JON, a building explodes from wildfire. The acrid green
         explosions speckle the burning city. DROGON flies in the distance. JON and DAVOS look
         at each other across the melee. They have both had enough. JON sheaths his sword.</p>

      <p>JON grabs a Stark soldier by the collar and forces him to join in the retreat. The
         Stark men begin to retreat. JON tries to command the civilians as well. One man is

      <p>ARYA lies unconscious on the ground, covered in a thin layer of ash. Blood from a
         head wound coats her cheek and has soaked into her tunic. She is awoken by an explosion
         nearby. She gasps and coughs. People shout in the distance. She pulls herself to her
         feet as people run past. She staggers and coughs, then stops to clear her lungs. Above
         her, the stone cracks in the high tower next to her, and begins its collapse. ARYA
         runs in terror as others around her scream and flee. Huge fragments fall around her,
         shaking the ground upon impact. ARYA is surrounded by dust.</p>
      
      
      <p>The air clears and ARYA sits against a wall, panting. She calms herself and sees citizens
         who have also taken shelter there. She moves over to them and takes the hand of the

      <p>Dothraki riders appear, and slaughter the men. ARYA leads NORA and VICKY down the
         street, running. The Dothraki ride past. ARYA is separated from NORA as they dive
         to opposite sides of the street to avoid a pair of galloping Dothraki.</p>

      <p>NORA yells in pain and ARYA grunts as they get her to her feet, her arm draped over
         ARYA's shoulder. They begin to limp down the street as others run and scatter. DROGON

         She approaches slowly and gently takes its reins. She calms the horse.</p>
