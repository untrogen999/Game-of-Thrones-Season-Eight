<title>EPISODE 5 - THE BELLS</title>
<direction>INT: DRAGONSTONE, VARYS'S CHAMBERS</direction>

<stageDirection>VARYS sits at an ornate desk, writing a letter about JON SNOW's true heritage. Only partially visible, it includes the phrases, "... is not the only Targaryen left, Rhaegar and Lyanna ..." and " ... their son lives still, hidden by Eddard Stark ... " and " ... he is the true heir to the Iron Throne ...". There is an knock on the door. VARYS discretely hides what he has been writing.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> Come in.</speech>

<stageDirection>The door opens and MARTHA enters, sheepish.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> And?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MARTHA" >MARTHA</speaker> (shakes her head)</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> Nothing?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MARTHA" >MARTHA</speaker> She won't eat.</speech>

<stageDirection>VARYS taps the table rhythmically as he thinks.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> We'll try again at supper.</speech>

<stageDirection>He returns to writing.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="MARTHA" >MARTHA</speaker> I think they're watching me.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> Who?</speech>
 

<speech><speaker who="MARTHA" >MARTHA</speaker> Her soldiers.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> Of course they are. That's their job.</speech>

<stageDirection>VARYS extends his hand kindly. MARTHA comes closer and clasps hold.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> What have I told you, Martha?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MARTHA" >MARTHA</speaker> The greater the risk, the greater the reward.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> (Nods.) Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.</speech>

<stageDirection>MARTHA exits.</stageDirection>

<direction>EXT: DRAGONSTONE SHORE, BEACH OVERLOOK</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION LANNISTER stands above the beach, watching a boat being beached by its crew. JON walks from the boat to VARYS.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE BEACH</direction>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> The Northern armies?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?</speech>

<stageDirection>JON and VARYS walk inland.</stageDirection>
 

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> She shouldn't be alone.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Aren't you worried for her?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> We're not much for riddles where I'm from.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> We both know what she's about to do.</speech>

<stageDirection>They pause. JON sighs.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> That's her decision to make. She is our queen.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> What do you want?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.</speech>

<stageDirection>JON considers.</stageDirection>
 

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I don't want it. I never have.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS">VARYS</speaker> (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true">VARYS: (Sighs.) I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true You will rule wisely and well, while she--</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> She is my queen.</speech>

<stageDirection>JON continues on, alone. VARYS sighs.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: BEACH OVERLOOK</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION continues to watch JON and VARYS from above, his brow furrowed from concern and contemplation..</stageDirection>

<direction>INT: DRAGONSTONE WAR ROOM</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION enters, stopping at the threshold.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Your Grace?</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS TARGARYEN does not reply. TYRION walks cautiously to DAENERYS, who stands, looking out at the shoreline.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> There's something you need to know.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Someone has betrayed me.</speech>

<stageDirection>Surprised, TYRION does not answer right away.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Yes.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Jon Snow.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Varys.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> He knows the truth about Jon.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> He does.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> And Varys?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> (angrily) You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> It was a mistake.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> She trusts me.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS does not reply.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> But it doesn't matter now.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> No. It doesn't matter now.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION takes measure of DAENERYS. She returns to her view of the landscape. She looks haggard and ill, more pale than ever with heavy bags under her eyes.</stageDirection>

<direction>INT: VARYS'S CHAMBERS, NIGHT</direction>

<stageDirection>VARYS sits writing by candlelight. In the distance, a door opens. VARYS looks up and folds the scroll he was writing. He uses the candle to set it aflame, then snuffs the burning parchment. The sound of footsteps draw closer. VARYS removes his rings and places them in a small bowl. He sits, quietly resigned to his fate. The plodding of the approaching guards echo in the chamber. The door opens and GREY WORM enters, accompanied by a handful of Unsullied. He pauses and gives VARYS a menacing look.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: CAVERNS BENEATH DRAGONSTONE</direction>

<stageDirection>GREY WORM and the Unsullied guards lead VARYS through the caverns by torchlight. They exit onto the rocky shore, passing an unhappy TYRION. DAENERYS stands in front of the surf with JON at her side. VARYS faces them, having accepted his fate. TYRION approaches from the side, and they exchange a knowing look.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> It was me.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VARYS" >VARYS</speaker> (Nods.) I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION and VARYS take in their good-bye. TYRION touches VARYS's shackled hands kindly, and steps away. VARYS fights to maintain his composure. DAENERYS steps forward.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...</speech>

<stageDirection>From behind her, DROGON's head emerges from the darkness, growling.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> ... sentence you to die. Dracarys.</speech>

<stageDirection>DROGON rears up behind DAENERYS and roars. Fright takes over VARYS's face. DROGON steadies himself, roars between his teeth, and quickly unleashes an inferno that consumes VARYS. TYRION watches, deeply sorrowful. JON stands quietly, willing himself to follow his queen.</stageDirection>

<direction>INT: DRAGONSTONE MAP ROOM, NIGHT</direction>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS sits by the fire, holding MISSANDEI's leather collar. GREY WORM stands at attention.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS hands the collar to GREY WORM. He looks it over, masking his pain, and throws it in the fireplace, where it shrivels and burns. At the sound of footsteps, GREY WORM regains his composure and turns to face JON as he enters. DAENERYS hides her sorrow as well.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> (in Valyrian) It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.</speech>

<stageDirection>GREY WORM nods and exits. JON approaches DAENERYS. There is an awkward silence.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> What did I say would happen if you told your sister?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I don't want it, and that's what I told him.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> I love you. And you will always be my queen.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS stands and walks to JON.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Is that all I am to you? Your queen?</speech>

<stageDirection>They kiss. It is tentative at first, and then passion consumes them, until JON pulls away. He looks at her, deeply conflicted. DAENERYS shakes her head ever so slightly.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> All right, then.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS takes a step back.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Let it be fear.</speech>

<direction>INT: DRAGONSTONE THRONE ROOM, NIGHT</direction>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS sits on the throne. TYRION and GREY WORM stand on the main floor, looking up at her.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> I beg you, my queen-</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION is silent and disappointed in her decision.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> (to GREY WORM) Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.</speech>

<stageDirection>Desperate, TYRION ascends the platform stairs to get closer to DAENERYS.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS considers TYRION's suggestion. She nods quietly to GREY WORM, accepting the plan.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.</speech>

<stageDirection>GREY WORM nods and then exits. TYRION and DAENERYS look at one another silently. Then TYRION slowly bows every so slightly, expressing his gratitude to his Queen. He turns and starts to walk away.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION stops and turns.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAENERYS" house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</speaker> It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION pivots and exits.</stageDirection>

<direction>EXT: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, DAY</direction>

<stageDirection>The citizens of King's Landing chatter as they move into the protective walls of the Red Keep. They hold onto their loved ones and carry supplies on their backs or balanced on their heads. The guards help to keep them moving through the main entrance to the Keep.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="GUARD 1" >GUARD 1</speaker> Let them pass.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="GUARD 2" >GUARD 2</speaker> Through the gate.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="GUARD 3" >GUARD 3</speaker> Get going.</speech>

<direction>EXT: THE SEAS OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING, DAY</direction>

<stageDirection>JON and TYRION ride in a boat towards land. TYRION broods while JON is resigned. DAVOS waits for them on the shore below King's Landing, where their forces have made camp.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE ENCAMPMENT, DAY</direction>

<stageDirection>The camp is busy as the forces prepare for the upcoming battle. DAVOS, TYRION, and JON pause a few yards from the shore.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</speaker> The rearguard should be here by daybreak.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> She wants to attack now.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Daybreak at the earliest.</speech>

<stageDirection>JON turns to talk with some Stark soldiers.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Careful with that.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> My lord.</speech>

<stageDirection>DAVOS turns to leave as well, but TYRION stays him.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="DAVOS" house="Seaworth">DAVOS</speaker> I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?</speech>

<direction>EXT: THE ENCAMPMENT, NIGHT</direction>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> He's always better when he's got some food in him.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.</speech>

<stageDirection>The encampment has gone quiet for the night. Braziers light the camp at regular intervals. THE HOUND and ARYA STARK ride into camp. A SOLDIER stops them.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Ay up. Where you going?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="ARYA" house="Stark">ARYA</speaker> I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.</speech>

<stageDirection>SOLDIER 3 is confused.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="THE HOUND" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</speaker> Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> I need to go talk to my captain.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="THE HOUND" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</speaker> Go ahead, talk to him.</speech>

<stageDirection>ARYA and THE HOUND continue on their way.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Where's he going?</speech>

<direction>CUT TO: ANOTHER PART OF THE ENCAMPMENT</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION walks past the Unsullied warriors who line the path. An UNSULLIED gives him a questioning look.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> (speaking Valyrian) I drink to eat the skull keeper.</speech>

<stageDirection>The UNSULLIED is unresponsive.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> (speaking Valyrian) I want to eat the skull keeper.</speech>

<stageDirection>Again, the UNSULLIED gives no response. TYRION clears his throat and tries again.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> (struggling to speak Valyrian) I want to see the ...</speech>

<speech><speaker who="UNSULLIED" >UNSULLIED</speaker> We speak the common tongue.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="UNSULLIED" >UNSULLIED</speaker> We have orders to guard the prisoner.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Ordered by whom? The queen herself?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="UNSULLIED" >UNSULLIED</speaker> No.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.</speech>

<stageDirection>The UNSULLIED looks to his comrades. They file away. TYRION enters the tent.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE PRISONER'S TENT</direction>

<stageDirection>JAIME LANNISTER sits, eyes closed, chained by his neck and hands. TYRION enters behind him,.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> How did they find you?</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME holds up his golden right hand as explanation.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Did you consider taking it off?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> And you're going back to her, to die with her.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> You've underestimated her before.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Difficult to do from here.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION holds up the key to JAIME's chains. JAIME exhales heavily, impressed at this turn of events.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> The city will fall tomorrow.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Why?</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION moves closer to JAIME, and crouches to meet him, eye to eye.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME considers.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Swear to me.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> You have my word.</speech>

<stageDirection>TYRION unlocks JAIME's bonds.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> I'll try.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Your queen will execute you for this.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME gives an apprehensive look. TYRION stands quickly.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> You would have.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME starts to protest, but he is interrupted by TYRION's embrace. They hold one another tightly, aware this could be the last time they ever see each other. TYRION cries with an upwell of emotion. With a final look, TYRION exits quickly.</stageDirection>

<direction>EXT: KING'S LANDING, MORNING</direction>

<stageDirection>It is a quiet and beautiful morning. The Ironborn Fleet sits in the harbor, sails furled. The scorpions are fully manned in preparation for the coming onslaught. EUROON strides to the foredeck of his ship as the soldiers behind him load the scorpion. His eyes scan the far distance, looking for a sign of enemy forces.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Eyes on the horizon!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Load the scorpion!</speech>

<stageDirection>On another ship, Lannister soldiers load a massive bolt onto their scorpion.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: OUTER WALL OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>Lannister archers hustle into position. Below them, city dwellers run towards the Red Keep for protection. Scorpions line the walls of King's Landing, loaded and ready.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Archers, close up!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN" >MAN</speaker> Come on!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 4" >SOLDIER 4</speaker> Up to the espringal!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 5" >SOLDIER 5</speaker> To the back of it!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 6" >SOLDIER 6</speaker> Archers, line up!</speech>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREET BELOW</direction>

<stageDirection>A stream of citizens rushes anxiously towards the Red Keep. Lannister soldiers march double time in the opposite direction.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="WOMAN" >WOMAN</speaker> This way! Come on!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Clear the streets now!</speech>

<stageDirection>Above the crowded street, citizen shutter their windows. Below people take shelter in their homes, one MAN grabbing his wife and picking up his child.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="WOMAN" >WOMAN</speaker> No!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN" >MAN</speaker> In, now. And you, come on.</speech>

<stageDirection>More citizens rush through the streets as others shutter their windows.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Inside, now!</speech>

<stageDirection>ARYA and THE HOUND walk calmly towards the Red Keep while anxious citizens stream around them. THE HOUND wears a hooded cloak to disguise his face.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Lannister soldiers move double time away from the Keep.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: A DIFFERENT STREET</direction>

<stageDirection>JAIME, cloaked and inconspicuous, removes the glove from his golden hand. He looks around.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 4" >SOLDIER 4</speaker> Make way for the Golden Company!</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME slides through the gate, down the center of a Golden Company battalion as they march in time.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 4" >SOLDIER 4</speaker> Close the gate!</speech>

<stageDirection>The gates close with a great clanging. JAIME continues to walk quietly towards the Keep.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>The Golden Company stands at attention. Some of their faces betray their trepidation towards the forthcoming battle. HARRY STRICKLAND guides his mount in front of them. His eyes are fixed on the distance, where the Stark forces stretch across the panorama.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY</direction>

<stageDirection>The battered and snarling Northmen are crowded together. Behind them, the Dothraki and the Unsullied stand ready. On a rise just behind them stands JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM. TYRION joins them as men file past. GREY WORM walks down the rise. They look at the battlements and forces in the near distance.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="TYRION" house="Lannister">TYRION</speaker> If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.</speech>

<stageDirection>JON looks at TYRION with apprehension. He exits, followed by DAVOS.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Move along now, lads.</speech>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>CERSEI LANNISTER walks to the window and surveys the great capital city. In the far distance is the wall where her loyal forces are stationed, and the great plain beyond where the Stark and Targaryen forces await. Behind her, QYBURN and SER GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE stand ready.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE GROUNDS OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>Masses of city dwellers continue to move through courtyards, gates, and walls to the protection of the Red Keep.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> That's it.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Keep moving.</speech>

<stageDirection>The crowd chatters as they churn towards the gate. Among them, THE HOUND becomes frustrated at the slow pace. He grabs NORA by the shoulder and brushes past her. ARYA returns her shock with a stare as she follows THE HOUND through the gate.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="THE HOUND" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</speaker> Move.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="NORA" >NORA</speaker> Get behind there.</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Close the gate! No more through!</speech>

<stageDirection>THE HOUND picks up the pace to make it through before the gate seals. ARYA follows. People rush through, but the gate closes in front of NORA and VICKY.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="NORA" >NORA</speaker> No!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="VICKY" >VICKY</speaker> No! Mommy!</speech>

<stageDirection>NORA, VICKY, and the others pound desperately on the massive doors.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="VICKY" >VICKY</speaker> No, please, sir!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 1" >MAN 1</speaker> Open the gate!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Close the gate!</speech>

<stageDirection>The massive crowd starts to panic, rushing towards to closed gate.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 2" >MAN 2</speaker> Open it!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 3" >MAN 3</speaker> Open the gate!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Get back!</speech>

<stageDirection>NORA points VICKY to sneak through the crowd towards another way into the Keep.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="NORA" >NORA</speaker> Look, try that one! Go! Go!</speech>

<stageDirection>The crowd surges, crushing soldiers and citizens against the closed gate. The clamor rises and people become even more desperate. Far behind, the hooded JAIME sees that the gates are closed. He tries to jostle his way forward.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> The gates are locked now!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="WOMAN" >WOMAN</speaker> Open!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Get back!</speech>

<stageDirection>Trapped by the crowd and still far from the gate, JAIME rips off his hood. He waves his golden hand at the soldiers, hoping that they will recognize him.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="WOMAN" >WOMAN</speaker> Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 4" >MAN 4</speaker> Please open the gate!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Go back to your homes!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Stay back! It's closed!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="JAIME" house="Lannister">JAIME</speaker> Soldier!</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME's cries are useless, lost in the din and chaos of the crowd.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 1" >SOLDIER 1</speaker> Move away! Stop!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 5" >MAN 5</speaker> Let us in!</speech>

<stageDirection>JAIME gives up in frustration. He turns and fights through the crowd, moving away from this gate.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="MAN 1" >MAN 1</speaker> We're not leaving!</speech>

<stageDirection>The crowd screams and shouts, growing larger by the minute. JAIME slips into any alleyway and runs.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>The shouts of the citizens have reached CERSEI's ears. She looks down soberly.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK AND TARGARYEN ARMY</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION surveys the two armies.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE OUTER WALL</direction>

<stageDirection>The Lannister soldiers scan the horizon.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: BLACKWATER BAY</direction>

<stageDirection>EURON paces while his men look to the sky. Something in the sun catches his eye, and he shields his eyes as he looks directly at it. DROGON emerges from the blinding sun, diving through the sky towards the fleet. The Ironborn react to the attack.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER" >SOLDIER</speaker> Turn!</speech>

<stageDirection>They bring the scorpion around and fire a bolt at DROGON. DAENERYS and DROGON evade the bolt and continue their steep dive.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>EURON has lost the dragon in the sun once again. DROGON soars above the fleet. With a roar, he levels his trajectory and lets forth an eruption of fire, decimating the boat in front of EURON, flying past with unbelievable speed. DROGON destroys another ship before arcing away for a second sortie.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="EURON" house="Greyjoy">EURON</speaker> Turn it around! Turn it around!</speech>

<stageDirection>Angry at the soldier's incompetence, EURON rushes to position the scorpion himself.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="EURON" house="Greyjoy">EURON</speaker> Get back! Back!</speech>

<stageDirection>He is too late. DROGON destroys another handful of ships as he strafes the fleet.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="EURON" house="Greyjoy">EURON</speaker> Fire!</speech>

<stageDirection>The scorpion fires at the banking DROGON, but misses. DAENERYS and DROGON come directly towards EURON's ship. The dragon belches forth fiery destruction, shattering EURON's ship as he leaps overboard to avoid incineration.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS and DROGON lay waste to the fleet and begin heading across the harbor towards the city itself, DROGON's tail skimming the water as they fly. Atop the walls, the soldiers aim their scorpions at the charging dragon.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> I can see her! Ready!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Move!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Fire!</speech>

<stageDirection>They fire a bolt, but DROGON gracefully dodges, continuing to close the distance to the city wall at tremendous speed.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Reload!</speech>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 3" >SOLDIER 3</speaker> Reload!</speech>

<stageDirection>The soldiers strain to ready the weapon for another strike.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Faster! Hurry!</speech>

<stageDirection>The bolt locks in place. They start to aim the scorpion, but they are too late. DROGON engulfs them in a great burst of flame. The soldiers and the scorpion disintegrate in the powerful eruption.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER 2" >SOLDIER 2</speaker> Fire!</speech>

<stageDirection>DROGON spews forth more destruction. Soldiers scream in agony. DAENERYS and DROGON swoop past as man and machine incinerate.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>It is quiet. The two forces are still in their stand off. HARRY STRICKLAND is mounted before the Golden Company. GREY WORM, JON, and DAVOS lead the Stark/Targaryen forces. GREY WORM takes a step forward, reacting to something no one else has sensed. A horse whinnies and the wind picks up, carrying the sound of great wings flapping. Everyone turns their heads to try and locate the rising sound. STRICKLAND seems to hone in on the location, but he is too late. The gated wall behind the Golden Company explodes in an enormous fireball, destroying a huge section of the wall and consuming dozens of soldiers as the fire spews forth in a rage. STRICKLAND is knocked from his horse by the blast as the Golden Company scatters and his mount expires. DROGON flies over the destruction.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>GREY WORM and the Unsullied charge, followed by the mounted Dothraki. Members of the Golden Company scream and writhe in agony as they burn. Stunned by the force of the blast, STRICKLAND pulls himself up on hands and knees. He sees the charging Dothraki army and panics. He finds his feet and begins flees towards the wall, limping and bloodied. The Dothraki ride past, as he looks nervously to either side. He falls, impaled by GREY WORM's spear. GREY WORM pauses to retrieve his spear from STRICKLAND's corpse with a grunt before resuming the charge with the rest of the Unsullied.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Screamingly wildly, the Dothroaki gallop through the broken wall into King's Landing. Continuing full speed, they rip through the Lannister soldiers just inside the walls, speeding through the street. The Lannister soldiers fall like dominoes, no match for the ferocity of their charge. Behind the Dothraki, the Stark forces reach the wall, roaring as they enter the city. One Stark soldier kneels by a severely burned member of the Golden Company who lies supine on the ground. The Stark soldier plunges his sword through the man's heart.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Above, DROGON flies along the wall and destroys another part of the battlement. The few Lannister soldiers who survived the Dothraki rise to meet the Stark men in battle, but they are no match. DROGON continues to destroy the unwieldy scorpions before they can even threaten the dragon. The Stark men continue to dispatch the Lannister soldiers, whose corpses begin speckle the streets. Scores of Lannister soldiers flee through an open yard, but DROGON catches up and destroys them with a mighty exhalation of fire. They die in a painful and brutal conflagration.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>CERSEI listens to the sounds of destruction - the rumbling explosions and the screeching roar of the distant dragon. A vast section of the outer wall burns as DROGON and DAENERYS fly toward another part of the city. DROGON unleashes his fire breath once again.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE BREACHED WALL</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION walks through the battlefield, stunned by the carnage. In the distance, more Northern soldiers rush towards the battle.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>DROGON strafes another row of scorpions, demolishing the ramparts where they are mounted.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>DROGON roars. QYBURN exits.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>GREY WORM leads JON, DAVOS, and a force of Northern soldiers and Unsullied warriors through the charred and burning wasteland. Bodies are strewn everywhere. A Lannister soldier tries to set upon GREY WORM, but the Unsullied captain gores him clean through with his spear. Other Lannister soldiers make futile attacks that are quickly dispatched by JON and his men. Before them, the streets are empty and clear.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING, A BIT LATER</direction>

<stageDirection>JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM reach a crowd of Stark soldiers who are at a stand off with a perhaps one hundred Lannister soldiers.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>The Stark men part to let JON and his companions through . JON, DAVOS, and GREY WORM stand in front of the Stark men facing the Lannister soldiers. The two sides take measure of one another, separated by the width of the street.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: FURTHER BACK IN KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION passes through a burning wall, making his way among piles of charred bodies. Ahead of him, some Unsullied warriors clear the streets. Beyond them is a bell tower and, further back, is the Red Keep. Smoke fills the air.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>JAIME runs through the streets and alleys, passing citizens who have yet to take shelter.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>CERSEI continues to survey the battle.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>Citizens look up to see DROGON and DAENERYS diving towards them. DROGON roars and the panic ensues as people begin to run, desperate and terrified. Some protect their children while others knock down anyone in their way.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="MAN" >MAN</speaker> Run. Run! Come on!</speech>

<stageDirection>DROGON roars and glides over a street filled with fleeing innocents. He lands atop a parapet and roars at the city dwellers who are trapped before him.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF</direction>

<stageDirection>JON and the leader of the Lannister battalion stare at one another.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE PARAPET</direction>

<stageDirection>DROGON braces himself and lets out a mighty roar.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF</direction>

<stageDirection>The leader of the Lannister soldiers hears the powerful roar. He seems to lose faith as he looks at the men around him. He drops in sword in surrender. The rest of the battalion follows suit, the message spreading through the troops behind him, back towards the Red Keep.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>JAIME ducks into a dark open doorway.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>TYRION stares at the bell, pleading with his eyes. It sways and begins to ring.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF</direction>

<stageDirection>JON hears the one bell ringing. It is joined by another, and another still. He looks up and sighs in relief.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: The tower of the Red Keep</direction>

<stageDirection>CERSEI slowly closes her eyes in defeat. Her face remains expressionless.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION looks over as DROGON roars. The bells become a chorus across King's Landing. His eyes are fixed on DAENERYS and her dragon as he waits for her to react.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE PARAPET</direction>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS sits atop DROGON, wide-eyed and fighting a frantic energy. She breathes deeply and her face twists with anger. She looks towards the Red Keep, built by her family and where the Targaryens had ruled for three hundred years. She thinks of all that she has suffered and endured and lost. Bells clamor as the Iron Fleet burns in far distance. She tries to choke back her rage, but she cannot. She spurs DROGON and the dragon takes to the sky.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION is distraught, staring in disbelief at DAENERYS's response to the bells.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: ABOVE KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>DAENERYS and DROGON fly directly towards the Red Keep. DROGON roars.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>CERSEI watches as DROGON and DAENERYS fly towards her.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>As DROGON flies overhead, the citizens and Lannister soldiers panic and run. Behind some fleeing guards, DROGON unleashes his fire, decimating the surrounding buildings and consuming the soldiers.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Just beyond, innocents flee as quickly as they can. DROGON rises behind them, constantly spewing his deadly torrent of flame. Buildings collapse under the inferno, and citizens disappear as the raging fire consumes them.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>TYRION breathes shakily as he watches helplessly.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>The citizens flee, screaming and panting. DROGON's fire obliterates them.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER STANDOFF</direction>

<stageDirection>JON watches DROGON from afar. The Lannister soldiers turn at the sounds of destruction. GREY WORM breathes deeply, cold vengeance in his eyes. At the back of the Lannister battalion, an eruption of DROGON's flame destroys a building and sends soldiers scattering. GREY WORM begins to lower his spear for attack. The leader of the Lannister soldiers spins quickly to face JON, knowing the terms of surrender have been breached. Before he can speak, GREY WORM changes his grip on his spear and hurls it through the man's chest. He falls, dead. JON's attention snaps to the ground in front of him. He hesitates. The Stark men act first, screaming a battle cry as they launch themselves at the Lannister soldiers. JON is frozen in indecision as his men begin to decimate the Lannister soldiers. Time slows down. Suddenly, JON comes to his senses. He grabs the man closest to him and pulls him back.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> No! Get back! Get back!</speech>

<stageDirection>The Northerners pour around him and JON manages to stop a handful. GREY WORM turns his head toward JON, staring with a look of fierce disapproval.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="JON" house="Stark">JON</speaker> Stay! Stay!</speech>

<stageDirection>JON's efforts are fruitless. GREY WORM stares coldly at him. Then a Lannister soldier attacks JON and he is forced into battle. GREY WORM turns to join the fray. JON defends and attacks. Further ahead, GREY WORM methodically dispatches guard after guard with precision and artistry. The Lannister soldiers are overwhelmed by the invading force. GREY WORM attacks with a brutality and rage, letting forth an uncharacteristic scream. His eyes are filled with hatred.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STREETS OF KING'S LANDING</direction>

<stageDirection>DROGON and DAENERYS strafe another street, decimating Lannister soldiers and buildings alike. The guards scream as they die painful deaths. Some citizens huddle for safety while others try to flee the path of destruction.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>JON continues to try to stay his men from engaging in battle.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Guards attack JON, forcing him back into the melee. The Stark men are starting to attack the fleeing citizens as well as Lannister soldiers. The frenzy of the battle takes over as the siege becomes a sacking of the city. The Unsullied attack expertly and without mercy.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>A little girl hides behind a pillar as others run. A Stark soldier tackles a citizen, and his wife leaps out to stop him.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="SOLDIER" >SOLDIER</speaker> Get off me! Get off, bitch!</speech>

<stageDirection>A Stark comrade pulls the woman off of the soldier and holds her back.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>DROGON lays waste to another street filled with innocents.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE STARK/LANNISTER BATTLE</direction>

<stageDirection>JON shambles forward, helpless to stop the carnage. Some Lannister soldiers try to direct citizens out of harm's way.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>JON's men continue to sack the city. He meet the attacks on him by reflex. He is overwhelmed by the wild carnage and is inability to stop it. He snaps to as one a Stark soldier drags a woman into an alley to rape her. The woman falls to the ground and tries to crawl away. The soldier continues his assault. Suddenly, JON grabs him from behind and pulls him off the woman, holding the soldier against the wall with his left hand and brandishing his sword. The soldier is surprised and confused. They exchange a look. The soldier looks at his intended victim and becomes defiant. JON runs him through, and the soldier collapses to the ground.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>JAIME swings his sword wildly at EURION, who evades back, stumbling against a boulder. JAIME brings down a powerful overhead swing that EURON dodges. Sword hits rock with a great clang.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: INSIDE THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>A piece of the ceiling falls, startling CERSEI. DROGON circles overhead. A great chunk of wall falls to the ground, crushing citizens below. DROGON and DAENERYS circle the keep, then bring their full force upon it. Spiraling about the Red Keep, DROGON slices through walls and towers with his devastating fire. The mighty castle starts to come undone and crash to the ground.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: THE SHORE BENEATH THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>The broken tower slides down the cliffside and into the water just beyond the beach. JAIME runs further into the cave while EURON pursues him. JAIME swings his sword, but EURON jumps back and counters with his own attack, slicing JAIME across the chest. JAIME staggers against the rock. Pivoting, JAIME knocks away EURON's sword with a blow, and they begin to grapple. EURON elbows JAIME in the face, wraps him up, and jerks him off balance. JAIME loses his sword. EURON throws JAIME into the rock, and staggers to catch his breath. JAIME tackles him, but EURON managed to get astride JAIME delivers repeated blows to his face. JAIME coils his legs and kicks EURON in the throat. EURON falls to the ground, gagging for air. JAIME tries to land a great punch, but EURON avoids him, and grapples JAIME onto the wet sand. EURON chokes JAIME while JAIME tries to push him away. JAIME lands a two-handed blow to EURON's arms, head butts EURON, and tosses him aside. JAIME chokes up blood as EURON crawls towards his sword. JAIME grabs EURON's foot, and pulls him back. EURON kicks JAIME dives, and grabs his sword as JAIME grapples him. EURON pulls himself around and plunges his sword into JAIME's side. JAIME reels with pain. EURON grunts and pants, then he pulls his sword free from JAIME's torso. They both fall back. JAIME scuttles on his back, away from EURON, then rolls onto his back, gasping.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>JAIME wheezes, helpless. He looks down the beach. His sword is far from his grasp. He rolls onto his stomach and crawls towards it. EURON sees that there is still some fight in JAIME and he drop his head, sighing. JAIME reaches his sword, but EURON stands above him and plunges his sword into JAIME's side once again. Both grunt, then JAIME pushes EURON onto the ground, and rights himself. He gores EURON through the stomach. They both yell. JAIME pushes his sword in further, pinning EURON against sand and rock. He steps back. EURON grabs the blade with both hands. Both pant and scream. JAIME forces the sword in further. Hate joins the pain on EURON's face.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="EURON" house="Greyjoy">EURON</speaker> Another king for you.</speech>

<stageDirection>EURON grunts and JAIME pulls out his sword and stands over EURON. Blood pours from his stomach as EURON's head bows in relief. JAIME starts his way into the cave. EURON slides down the rock towards the sand. He twists his head to watch JAIME leave.</stageDirection>

<direction>CUT TO: SPIRAL STAIRCASE OF THE TOWER OF THE RED KEEP</direction>

<stageDirection>CERSEI, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN, and the Queensguard descend the tower</stageDirection>
<stageDirection>staircase as DROGON roars overhead. A great section of the ceiling collapses behind them, revealing the ferocious glow of the fireball overhead. The tower shakes and the party falls to their knees. THE MOUNTAIN is felled by a chunk from the ceiling. Above them, the tower ceiling comes apart. THE MOUNTAIN shields CERSEI and PYCELLE with his body, taking great blows from the chunks that rain down. CERSEI cowers. DROGON roars again and the entire ceiling gives way, burying some of the Queensguard.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>When then destruction settles, THE MOUNTAIN stands erect. CERSEI and QYBURN are unharmed. There is nothing left of the tower behind them, only open sky filled with smoke. Debris falls continuously as the tower above them crumbles. THE HOUND enters below them. He nods at CERSEI.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="THE HOUND" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</speaker> Your Grace.</speech>

<stageDirection>The four remaining Queensguard rush down to engage THE HOUND. He easily dispatches each of them in turn. He looks up to THE MOUNTAIN.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="QYBURN" >QYBURN</speaker> Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.</speech>

<stageDirection>QYBURN moves to intercept THE MOUNTAIN. The hulk effortlessly picks up QYBURN by the neck and tosses him down the steps. QYBURN's head smashes against the rubble-strewn stairs when he lands, cracking his skull and killing him instantaneously. THE MOUNTAIN takes a few more steps towards THE HOUND as CERSEI quivers behind him. DROGON roars. The Clegane brothers take measure of one another. CERSEI tentatively walks past THE MOUNTAIN and then slides past THE HOUND. She exits. More rubble falls as DROGON soars overhead, spewing fire.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>THE HOUND walks up the stairs towards THE MOUNTAIN, then draws his sword and starts his attack. THE MOUNTAIN fends off the blows with his armored arms, then grabs THE HOUND's blade. Enraged, THE HOUND rips his weapon free and attacks anew. THE MOUNTAIN parries with his arm. On his third blow, THE HOUND knocks off THE MOUNTAIN's helmet, revealing his brother's ghoulish face. The skin of THE MOUNTAIN'S revived corpse is fetid and rotting.</stageDirection>

<speech><speaker who="THE HOUND" house="Clegane">THE HOUND</speaker> Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.</speech>

<stageDirection>The castle continues to fall around her as CERSEI makes her way through the Red Keep. DROGON roars overhead. An exhausted JAIME enters the courtyard. CERSEI turns and sees JAIME propping himself up against a pillar. Her face brightens as she stares at him with disbelief. She sobs and he walks to her. They embrace and hold tight, panting. JAIME looks at her tears.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>THE HOUND and THE MOUNTAIN battle ferociously. THE HOUND spins, traps THE MOUNTAIN's arms between his body and his left arm, then leverages THE MOUNTAIN's sword away. He steps back and plunges his sword into THE MOUNTAIN's stomach, grunting with effort. He looks up with gritted teeth and forces the blade in further. THE MOUNTAIN stands impassive, one hand cupping the blade. THE HOUND cannot believe that THE MOUNTAIN still stands. He roars and pushes the blade harder. THE MOUNTAIN unleashes a mighty backhand that sends THE HOUND tumbling backward down the steps. THE HOUND struggles to look up. He watches THE MOUNTAIN pull the blade from hit gut, his armor falling away. THE MOUNTAIN descends towards THE HOUND, who sighs in exasperation. The tower continues to collapse. THE HOUND chuckles at the impossibility of it all. THE MOUNTAIN grabs him by the collar, and flips him over, roughly.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>Flapping can be heard overhead. ARYA quickens her pace and collides with a man wearing a turban. DROGON roars. ARYA and the man push past one another.

ARYA flees. The man in front of her is felled by debris.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>DROGON roars and flies over them, his mouth spewing flames. ARYA jostles through the alley and into a flood of people running in panic. She gets pulled into the screaming mob.

<stageDirection>THE MOUNTAIN throws THE HOUND to the ground again. THE HOUND groans. THE MOUNTAIN picks his brother up by the neck and chokes him, slamming him against the wall. THE HOUND gurgles, exhausted and desperate for air. Gagging, THE HOUND tries to gain purchase on THE MOUNTAIN's hands. He shakes and writhes as THE MOUNTAIN pins him to the wall. THE HOUND frees his dagger from his belt and stabs THE MOUNTAIN just above the clavicle. THE MOUNTAIN does not react. THE HOUND stabs again with a grunt. Again, THE MOUNTAIN does not react. THE HOUND then stabs THE MOUNTAIN repeatedly in the torso.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>THE HOUND stabs THE MOUNTAIN below the neck once more. THE HOUND laughs and chokes at the impossibility of THE MOUNTAIN's stamina. THE MOUNTAIN moves his thumbs atop the HOUND's eyes, presses his hands like a vice around THE HOUND's head, and raises his brother high in the air. He presses his thumbs into THE HOUND's eye sockets. THE HOUND lets out short screams, his feet dangling helplessly. He blindly feels around THE MOUNTAIN's face before plunging his dagger deep into THE MOUNTAIN's left eye, the blade penetrating clean through to the other side. THE MOUNTAIN steps backward and THE HOUND collapses onto the floor. THE MOUNTAIN staggers backward, confused and blinded. THE HOUND coughs and sits upright. THE HOUND growls at his brother and pants. The MOUNTAIN regains his composure and slowly reaches for the hilt of the knife. The HOUND watches in disbelief. The MOUNTAIN starts to tug at the dagger. Screaming, THE HOUND launches himself at his brother. Just as THE MOUNTAIN frees the dagger from his face, THE HOUND tackles him. They crash through the compromised wall behind them. They fall amidst an avalanche of stone down to the raging fire far below and disappear into the conflagration.</stageDirection>

Above her, the stone cracks in the high tower next to her, and begins its collapse. ARYA runs in terror as others around her scream and flee. Huge fragments fall around her, shaking the ground upon impact. ARYA is surrounded by dust.</stageDirection>

<stageDirection>It is quiet. Smoke and huge flakes of ash waft though the air. ARYA sits quivering beside a blackened wall. She stands shakily and starts putting one foot in front of the other. She walks through the decimated streets. Fires burn everywhere. The street is littered with blackened bodies. ARYA sees the corpses of NORA and VICKY, embracing in death. She looks down the street, and sees a white horse, improbable as it is. She approaches slowly and gently takes its reins. She calms the horse.</stageDirection>
